        "full_content": "\n### **Berkeley Opera Production of the Condensed Version of Wagner's *Der Ring des Nibelungen* by David Seaman, *The Legend of the Ring*\n**\n\n* Classical Music Column, Bay Area News Preview Section/Inside Bay Area, for July 30, 2010*\n\nOne of the most frequent complaints folks have about composer Richard Wagner's epic four-opera cycle based on the old Germanic legends of *Der Ring des Nibelungen* is that it's sooo long!\n\nA thought I've long harbored regarding the irascible 19th-century German composer-author of the vaunted \"Ring\" Cycle is that the fellow could have greatly benefited from the condense and/or delete philosophy of some of my skilled editors.\n\nFortunately, David Seaman, a witty Welsh chap from that country's National Opera, has committed a sort of coup de grace upon Wagner's long-windedness by condensing the whole four-performance epic into a single brilliant, cogent three-hour masterpiece called *The Legend of the Ring*.\n\nFollowing the premiere of Seaman's version, given by Pocket Opera Nuremberg, the country's prestigious *Die Welt* newspaper pronounced it a dramatic compression that brings the characters more sharply into focus, adding the caveat that, \"Every bar is original Wagner in seamless juxtaposition.\"\n\nAfter its 2004 Berkeley Opera premiere, the late great Bay Area music critic Stephanie von Buchau (who was never accused of being easy to impress,) wrote that the show produced \"more goose bumps and emotion than many of the 17 cycles of Wagner's masterwork that I have attended in 55 years of international opera-going.\"\n\nMoreover, the daring endeavor even has the blessings of the Wagner Society of Northern California.\n\nStarting at 8 p.m. July 31, the Berkeley Opera will repeat its 2004 *Ring* blockbuster with four performances at the state-of-the-art El Cerrito Performing Arts Theater, on the El Cerrito High School campus. The current performances are under the direction of Mark Streshinsky, who also served as the director/production designer of the acclaimed 2004 production.\n\nThe youthful, energetic Streshinsky, recently named Berkeley Opera's new artistic director, elaborates about his production innovations of the Wagner condensation.\n\n\"David Seaman's version is just three hours long and uses eight performers and a reduced orchestra. With the help of a video artist, I designed projected scenery that used video, photo montage, (including) extensive use of shadow, and still photography to suggest the locales and magic.\"\n\nThe musical director is Wagner-savvy Jonathan Khuner, with projections by Jeremy Knight, lighting by Lucas Kresch and costumes by Romy Douglass. Alex Kort serves as production manager.\n\nThe show has also attracted a stellar cast, all of whom are Wagner veterans familiar on many of the world's great operatic stages. Three are graduates of San Francisco Opera's Merola program. Merola alum Richard Paul Fink, a baritone and renowned Wagnerian, will sing the role of Wotan, the chief Germanic god. Dramatic soprano Christine Springer will repeat her performance from the 2004 Berkeley Opera production of *The Legend of the Ring* of the three Br√ºnnhilde roles and also sing Rhinemaiden Wellgune in the opening scene.\n\nSoprano Marie Plette, a 1992 Merola alumna and Streshinsky's wife, will sing the roles of Sieglinde, Freia, Gutrune, Woglinde and the Forest Bird. Jay Hunter Morris, an appropriately Nordic-looking tenor, is cast in the role of Siegfried. Another Merolini, the splendid actor/bass-baritone Bojan Knezevic, will likely produce a fascinating portrayal of Alberich. A mesmerizing powerhouse on stage, Knezevic recently reaped rave reviews singing the title role of the acclaimed Ensemble Parallele's production of Alban Berg's *Wozzeck* at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Bass Dean Peterson will sing the challenging role of Hagen, and tenor Stephen Rumph will sing both Loge and Mime. Valentina Osinski, mezzo-soprano, will sing the roles of Fricka and Flosshilde. Interestingly, the glamorous Osinski, although considered a specialist in modern works, claims the witch in Humperdinck's *Hansel and Gretel* as her signature role. Stephen Rumph will sing the tenor roles on Loge and Mime.\n\nBerkeley Opera has garnered a luminous reputation since its 1979 founding by Richard Goodman. Jonathan Khuner assumed leadership in 1994 and was joined this season by Streshinsky as artistic director.\n\nFrom its genesis, the plucky company has been committed to presenting opera as lively, compelling musical theater, fusing music and drama in ways that both delight and challenge audiences. The company's originality has earned it a reputation of being one of the most interesting small companies in the nation.\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n",

Since the birth last week of James, my first grandchild, I have found that some of the little one's lustiest cries can usually be quieted by turning up the volume on a CD of Bach's *Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring*, or the *Brandenburg Concerto No. 3*. Little James even seems pretty keen on Mozart's *Piano Concerto No. 21*, as well of the strains of Brahms' *Lullaby* from my own scratchy voice.\n\nThis happy event, as well as some of the Bay Area musical events coming up within the next few weeks, remind me of a wonderful newspaper item that appeared a while back in the New York Times. Its headline read, \"Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies.\"\n\nThe article than quoted an apparently discerning Governor Zell Miller of the State of Georgia as saying, \"Having an infant listen to soothing music helps those trillions of brain connections to develop.\"\n\nGovernor Miller then acted on this belief by proposing that, as part of his state's $12.5 billion budget, $105,000 be spent to make music available to each of the approximately 100,000 children born in Georgia each year. Miller suggested that a worthy cassette tape or CD be included along with the usual paraphernalia that hospitals send home with newborns and their moms in his state.\n\nMiller, who happens to be a fan of country and bluegrass music, was convinced that the music of composers like Bach and Mozart can stimulate brain development at very early ages.\n\nHe is not alone. Back in 1993 researchers at the Irvine campus of the University of California suggested that humans are born with certain brain cells that respond to musical sounds. \"These neurons work in patterns that can be expanded as a sort of `pre-language' to perform increasingly complex interactions -- even before the brain has developed verbal language skills,\" according to UC Irvine physicist Gordon Shaw.\n\nShaw, along with a number of other scientists (as well as a lot of us parents!) believe that this ability may bolster higher-level thinking skills. After all, both Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein spent many hours each week playing the violin!\n\nResearchers at the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at UC Irvine, documented that 10 minutes of listening to Mozart's *Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major* as performed by Murray Perahia and Radu Lupu, temporarily raised the measurable IQ of college students by up to nine points.\n\nThe researchers went on to suggest that classical music, probably because of its complexity, is more effective at such cognitive boosting than simple, repetitive grunge rock or minimalist music. New Age jazz, they felt, may actually interfere with abstract reasoning.\n\nAnd even further back in history, to the \"Golden Age\" of Greece circa 450 B.C., the study of music was considered just as essential to the development of the whole person as was the study of mathematics, rhetoric, and participation in athletics.

        "full_content": "\n### **Merola Opera World Premiere of Thomas Pasatieri's Opera, *Hotel Casablanca*\n**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column for August 3, 2007*\n\nRichard Kagey, the stage director for the Merola Opera Program's upcoming world premiere of Thomas Pasatieri's new opera, *Hotel Casablanca*, was hand-picked for the job by the composer himself. Nice distinction.\n\nBut then it seems that the same distinction also applies to the opera's conductor, Joseph Illick. All three of these creative gentlemen just finished working together on the critically acclaimed premiere of Pasatieri's *Frau Margot* for the Fort Worth Opera. During the last few weeks the trio has been applying its serendipitous chemistry toward guiding the nine-member cast of the Merola Opera Program's production of *Hotel Casablanca*, scheduled at 8 tonight and 2 p.m. Sunday at Cowell Theater in San Francisco.\n\nTonight's production marks a milestone in Merola's illustrious 50-year history. It is the program's first world premiere ‚Äî and what a choice: Not only is the name \"Hotel Casablanca\" rife with connotations of romance and drama, but its libretto is based on the riotous 19th-century French play, *A Flea in her Ear*, written by the La Belle Epoch master of wit and farce, Georges Feydeau. In Pasatieri's hands, however, the original Parisian bedroom farce, jollied up with mistaken identities and multiple misunderstandings, is transferred to a hot summer at the Double T Ranch in Texas in 1948, where a wealthy couple determines to \"toughen up\" their 25-year-old visiting nephew from New York. What in the Feydeau original was a disreputable Parisian hotel becomes the seedy Hotel Casablanca near the ranch in Pasatieri's version.\n\nIn the production, Maestro Illick will conduct nine singers and a 17-member chamber orchestra. The singers are selected members of the 2007 Merola Opera Training Program, which began June 4 and will culminate with the annual Merola Grand Finale Concert at 7:30 p.m. Aug. 18 at the San Francisco Opera House.\n\nLeading the cast as Charles Carter, the bedeviled nephew, is tenor Andrew Bidlack from Chambersburg, Pa. Bidlack's previous operatic roles have included Rudolfo in *La Boheme* and Bastien in Mozart's *Bastien and Bastienne*. Uncle Tom Carter will be sung by bass-baritone Tom Corbeil of San Diego; Auntie Tallulah Carter by soprano Tamara Wapinsky from Pottsville, Pa.; and Burton the Butler by baritone Jason Plourde of Caribou, Maine.\nOther roles in this mildly racy romp will be Raul Perez, the bull breeder, by baritone Nathaniel Hackmann of Phoenix; Lucy Perez, Raul's wife, by mezzo-soprano Paula Murrihy of Tralee, Ireland; Tobias, the Double T's manager, by bass Kenneth Kellogg of Washington, D.C.; Miss Pooder, the proprietor of Hotel Casablanca, by mezzo-soprano Meredith Woodend of Kissimmee, Fla.; and Veronique, a hotel employee, by soprano Jamie-Rose Guarrine of Peoria, Ill.\n\nAccording to director Kagey, composer-librettist Pasatieri, who was born in New York in 1945, is not only musically ingenious but verbally clever as well. He entered the Juilliard School at age 16 and went on to become the prestigious music school's first recipient of a doctorate. In addition to his 19 operas and many other compositions, Pasatieri is a highly acclaimed orchestrator-arranger. He's composed the scores for movies such as *The Good German*, *The Road to Perdition*, *American Beauty*, *The Little Mermaid*, *The Shawshank Redemption*, *Fried Green Tomatoes*, *Legends of the Fall* and *Scent of a Woman*.\n\nKagey not only has a gift for stage and set design but he is thoroughly adept at leading and directing young people. Tall, affable and ever ready with his warm, baritone laugh, he has a natural affinity for gracefully bringing the quirks and subtleties of human nature to the stage. Long associated with the academic world (the faculty of the University of Maryland, plus other schools), he has spent summers for more than 40 years directing young people with operatic aspirations at the Seagle Music Colony in the Schroon Lake area of upper New York. His most recent endeavor has been directing Pasatieri's *Frau Margot* with the Fort Worth Opera. Upcoming engagements include *The Merry Widow* at the Seagle Music Colony; *Hotel Casablanca* for the University of Kentucky; *Cold Sassy Tree* for Atlanta Opera; and *Of Mice and Men* for Fort Worth Opera. He also will direct the soon-to-open Energy Center for the Performing Arts in Atlanta. He and his wife, Betsy, an epidemiologist, make their home in Atlanta.\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **High-Tech Hand-Held Concert Companion for Symphony Audiences**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column for February 25, 2005*, under headline,\n#### Oakland East Bay Symphony tries latest in PDAs for concerts\n\nCan high-tech and fine art coexist?\n\nEvidently, yes. But just to make sure, check out the Oakland East Bay Symphony Orchestra's performance tonight at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. Michael Morgan will conduct -- and high-tech CoCo will be circulated throughout the audience to help out.\n\nSo just what IS CoCo? No, it is not an exceedingly smart gorilla, but rather, a sort of personal digital assistant (PDA), a concert companion -- nicknamed \"CoCo\" for short.\n\nLooking like a hand-held computer or calculator, it has a small screen that can deliver to the person holding it, pre-written program notes, real time commentary on the music being performed, and video images of the conductor or various instruments featured in particular musical passages.\n\nA wireless network, staffed by an operator, will be set up in the Paramount to keep the device in synch with the live music. There will also be cameras at various locations within the Paramount to enable CoCo's video portions. Moreover, the device has a \"menu\" from which its holders may choose among its various functions.\n\nThere are indeed a couple of successful high-tech precedents to CoCo. One is the audio guide -- the little phone-like device with stop, go, and repeat buttons -- distributed by art galleries and museums to enhance patrons' viewing experiences. Once turned on, the little device guides its individual user to significant paintings or items and then explains that particular item's history and relevant details in lay terms. One of these little gizmos in hand is like having one's own private, personal guide to the gallery or museum.\n\nOpera has been another recipient of high-tech resuscitation with its use of supertitles. Now employed by most of the world's opera houses, supertitles are simultaneous translations of whatever language is being sung, into the primary language of the audience. These are projected either over or on the sides of the stage, in a concise, easy-to-read format (in the case of the Metropolitan Opera, onto a video screen the back of the seat in front of the user).\n\nUp until the use of supertitles, many people simply wouldn't consider sitting through several hours of goings-on in languages they didn't understand. Supertitles have drawn vast numbers of new, young audiences to the art form, while enhancing the experiences for the already converted.\n\nBut, what about that far more abstract artistic endeavor -- the instrumental concert?\n\nA few years ago, a savvy chap named Rolland Valliere, watching the successes of opera companies and museums with their high-tech helpers, hit upon a solution. During a telephone chat last week, he explained the details to me.\n\nAfter his own ruminations on the subject, he sought out some help. He succeeded in teaming up with Opera Glass Networks, a multimedia information technology company, Professor Robert Winter of UCLA, Antenna Audio in San Francisco, and others, who combined their efforts to develop what has become known as \"CoCo.\"\n\n\"If there could be an auditory enhancement of a visual experience,\" Valliere said, \"why not flip things over and have a visual enhancement of an aural experience? Why not give some real time help to new concert audiences so that they too can have deeper experiences of what is happening on the stage?\"\n\nUpon completion, CoCo was tested by the Kansas City Symphony in March of 2003; the Aspen Festival in July, 2003; the Philadelphia Orchestra during its performances at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in August, 2003; and finally, with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in May, 2004.\n\nIt was a hit with its audience users.\n\nValliere described some of the subsequent survey responses, noting that 94% of the respondents said they would use CoCo again and 93% reported that they would recommend it to a friend. A whopping 60% said they would attend concerts more often if CoCo were available and 91% rated its ease of use as \"good\" or \"excellent.\"\n\nAs a result, the endeavor has attracted funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, The David and Lucille Packard Foundation, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, DST Systems, Inc. and Hall Family Foundation.\n\nValliere brings both advanced musical knowledge and keen business acumen to his mission of making concert music more understandable and appealing to its audiences, especially to the new or infrequent concert-goer. Born in Rhode Island, he received a bachelor's degree in percussion performance from the New England Conservatory of Music and a master's degree in fine arts from Brandeis University. He has performed as a professional percussionist in the Boston area and has served as an instructor of music theory and music history at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge.\n\nOn the music business side of the coin, his accomplishments include serving as executive director of the Kansas City, Omaha, and New Hampshire Symphonies as well as the Hudson Valley Philharmonic.\n\nAlthough the majority of audiences seem to like CoCo, not all the people on the production side of the music world do. One highly respected musicologist and program annotator compared \"CoCo\" to the \"Anti-Christ\" so far as classical music is concerned. And indeed, the head of the Metropolitan Opera once said of the use of supertitles, \"Not over my dead body.\"\n\nAs usual, Maestro Michael Morgan, OEBS' conductor and music director, takes the enlightened view: \"As a professional musician I am, of course, somewhat ambivalent about such devices. But I am also smart enough to know that if using this brings people, particularly new and infrequent concert-goers, closer to the music and provides a more enjoyable experience, then it could be a wonderful tool. We are happy to be a part of this international experiment.\"\n\nInterestingly, concurrent with CoCo's Bay Area debut, the Rand Corporation has released its latest report on arts funding entitled \"Gifts of the Muse: Reframing the Debate About the Benefits of the Arts.\" One of Rand's key findings, according to Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times, \"is that the arts won't flourish unless more arts lovers are minted through sustained exposure during childhood.\"\n\nAnd, I would add, that this \"sustained exposure\" should be sustained throughout one's lifetime. Of course, the old adage applies: \"You can bring a horse to the water, but you can't force him to drink.\" So, it takes more than just sitting someone down in a concert hall and barring all the doors until the concert is finished. While exposure can help, it is not enough. The concert experience must include some way to inform and explain what is going on, in an easy, appealing manner. CoCo just might be able to do this.\n\nAnd a little afterthought -- bring your teenagers to the concert. They can certainly help us older folk operate CoCo.\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

Or is it good drama set to appealing tunes?\n\nAccording to **Maestro David Sloss**, conductor, professor and director of operas, symphonies and other sundry musical ensembles, it can combine both of the above ‚Äî but sadly, not often enough.\n\nSays Sloss, \"Once in a while, we are given a work in which both the music and the drama are at the highest level and perfectly matched.\" One of those few is Gioachino Rossini and Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais' *The Barber of Seville*. To my query about which other operas in the repertory Sloss would include among this rare group, he quickly replied, \"Almost all of Mozart's, of course.\" Then he added *Tosca* and *La Boheme* by Puccini and Bizet's *Carmen*. \"No Wagner?\" I asked.\n\nAfter hesitating a few seconds, he said, \"Well, I can tell you what Rossini (who lived from 1792 to 1868) said about Wagner's operas: Rossini said that one could find some of opera's best moments and very worst quarter-hours in his operas. He also said that Wagner's *Lohengrin* couldn't be assessed with only one hearing ‚Äî but that he personally, didn't want to ever hear it again.\"\n\nSloss and his wife, Barbara, are the founders and prime movers of the year-old [**Fremont Opera**](http://www.fremontopera.org/). The fledgling company's second production, *The Barber of Seville*, will be performed in the Jackson Theatre of the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Fremont next week.\n\nAccording to Sloss, the cast ‚Äî led by Eugene Brancoveanu as Figaro the barber and Nikki Einfeld as Rosina, with Eleazar Rodriguez as Count Almaviva, Jason Budd as Dr. Bartolo, Kirk Eichelberger as Don Basilio and Elspeth Franks as Berta ‚Äî is absolutely top-notch. Jonathon Field will be the stage director and Sloss will conduct.\n\nBrancoveanu recently has won both critical and public acclaim as an \"extravagantly gifted\" baritone for his sensitive performance as the pilot in San Francisco Opera's spring production of Rachel Portman's *The Little Prince*. Born in Romania, the dashing Brancoveanu will take on the role of Belcore in San Francisco Opera's production of *L'Elisir d'Amore* this coming season.\n\nAttractive young Einfeld, who like Brancoveanu and Eichelberger trained with the Merola Program, recently has sung the saucy part of Susanna in Mozart's opera *The Marriage of Figaro*, composed to Lorenzo da Ponte's version of a segment of Beaumarchais' satirical saga on barber Figaro and his 17th century friends.\n\nThe Fremont Opera's *Barber* will be semi-staged, with costumes, relevant props, intricate stage direction and theatrical lighting, but no sets and scenery. It will be sung in Italian, with English supertitles.\n\nSloss explained that not paying for sets and scenery is quite intentional. \"It makes it possible to use our money to pay for super singers and a full-size orchestra.\"\n\nMUSIC'S MAN ON THE MOVE: Armed with a Ph.D. in medieval and Renaissance music from Stanford University, rising young composer **Nolan Gasser** has been providing some significant thrust into the music vs. words debate lately. His NASA-commissioned *GLAST Prelude* for brass quintet accompanied the launch of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida last June 11.\n\nHowever, his latest piece, *American Festivals*, might have the potential to become our own home-grown, thoroughly colloquial ode to joy. A joint effort of Gasser and librettist-poet Robert Trent Jones Jr., the work received its rousing world premiere in July at the opening event of Napa Valley's Festival del Sole.\n\nDescribed as a symphonic oratorio, each of its four movements ‚Äî \"Independence Day,\" \"Memorial Day,\" \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day\" and \"Thanksgiving\" ‚Äî includes words imaginatively set for full orchestra, chorus, soloists and/or orator.\n\nHowever, according to Gasser, his intention was to go further than perfunctory flag-waving, by relating to the people and problems of our own times.\n\n\"The words,\" he says, \"explore our national identity as well as our responsibilities as Americans ‚Äî including, as Ben Franklin said, questioning our leaders through the difficulty of wars and civil rights and race issues.\" The massive indoor and outdoor Festival del Sole audience reacted with exuberant cheers, whoops and lengthy applause to the piece's premiere performance. Gasser's music brilliantly related to the poetry with relevant, inventive references such as an evocation of the pealing of the Liberty Bell on its original pitch of E-flat; the use of a tenor saxophone playing a sometimes bluesy but ultimately inspiring theme to represent Martin Luther King; intricate counterpoint passages recalling early liturgical music; the use of the haunting Native American flute, mourning bagpipes, and appealing snippets of familiar tunes and hymns reminiscent of the style of Charles Ives.\n\nHis latest commission is to create a piece he's calling *Cosmic Reflections*, a major three-movement symphony for full orchestra scheduled to premiere in October 2009 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n***\n\nNolan Gasser's *GLAST Prelude* received mention in the [July 11, 2008 issue of *Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5886/183b).

Valery Gergiev, the Moscow-born Ossetian conductor, is a genuine musical phenomenon.\n\nAlthough I'm still struggling through the pea-soup fog of the jet-lagged after my return to the Bay Area in pre-sunrise hours this morning (Sept. 19), I feel an urgency to share highlights from my intense week in the Netherlands. It was spent under the Olympian shadow of this remarkable conductor during rehearsals and ultimate performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on September 17 in Rotterdam. The concert represented the culmination of a 10-day Freedom Festival under Gergiev's leadership. (Gergiev comes to the Bay Area on October 16, in a Cal Performances presentation in Berkeley.)\n\n*\n\nI was traveling with the Yale University Alumni Chorus, which, with a similar group from the Cambridge (England) University Music Society, was chosen to work with Gergiev and the Rotterdam Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a performance of the Beethoven masterwork.\n\nIt was a roller coaster ride rocked with twists and turns of mighty Sturm und Drang.\n Gergiev, 53, as with past geniuses of his ilk, has been called \"difficult,\" \"distant\" and \"dismissive.\" Many say he is a tough, even merciless, taskmaster. But alongside these cants are rosier descriptors like \"brilliant,\" \"intense,\" \"mystical\" and \"uncannily profound.\"\n\nAccording to my experience, he appears to be ALL of the above. Like some of his musical genius predecessors, he can be demanding and mercurial. Think Wagner, Mahler and even Beethoven. But other aspects are redolent of Tchaikowsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. One thing is sure: The man is totally dedicated to his art.\n\nIn a still-relevant interview for the June 1992 issue of Opera News*, my distinguished ANG music colleague Stephanie von Buchau quotes Gergiev as saying \"Classical music is more than temporary pleasure. Art is not about revolution, politics or who is in power. If we mix these, as they did in the past, it will be dangerous, and I'm not going to allow it in my theater.\"\n\n\"His\" theater, is the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, home to the Kirov Ballet, Opera and Orchestra. At the time of the quote, he was referring to the crumbling Communist leadership of the former Soviet Union. But his comments can be universally applied today. They neatly describe the Rotterdam Festival title: Freedom (in Dutch, \"Vrijheid\").\n\nFollowing the chorus' first encounter with the Maestro during the evening rehearsal Sept. 15, reactions were none too positive. \"The first word that came to my mind,\" said one of the more tolerant of the participating Yalies, was `dismissive.'\" Another more kindly comment from another Bay Area-based chorus member was,\"He needs work on his people skills and in time management.\"\n\nOthers were angrier. Their main reason was, that after arriving at the agreed-upon rehearsal time, Gergiev told them to sit in the back in the auditorium and wait until he was finished with the orchestra. They sat for two long hours during what one person called \"Gergiev's long master class for the orchestra.\"\n\nWhen they were finally called to join the rehearsal, there was no apology for the wait, nor a particularly warm welcome or acknowledgement to the chorus for its pro-bono effort. After a terse \"hello,\" the Maestro simply launched into the music.\n\nMy first chance to observe the real, live Maestro was when he appeared before the assembled, waiting orchestra and chorus for the rehearsal of Arnold Schoenberg's \"A Survivor from Warsaw\" the next day. Again, Gergiev offered only a curt \"hello\" to the musicians, and, a bit later, a comparatively warm welcome to Maximillian Schell, the German-speaking world's answer to Sir Lawrence Olivier, who narrated the work.\n\nAttitudes, however, changed dramatically AFTER the performance. Where there was once doubt, there was now unabashed praise and even wonderment at what most interpreted as his almost mystical skill in communicating exactly what he wanted from them, and all the while, totally (but wordlessly) convincing them that he knew the composers' minds.\n\nThe actual performance was a Beethoven's 9th like I've never before heard. Both the chorus and the audience were euphoric afterward. There was an intensity about it, that, although still respectably refined, maintained a seething, almost raw power about it. It had an almost Russianized Beethoven in its power and passion. Even during its precise, contrapuntal-like passages, as well as its gently expansive slow movement, Gergiev was able to keep the mood taut and intense and clearly headed toward some great ultimate goal. Although he certainly kept the lid on the figurative pot, one had the sense that it was always just about to boil over.\n\nWas there enough juice left for the piece's \"Ode to Joy\" finale?\nYes indeed. The chorus glistened with a resplendent and balanced sonority and power. (I was sitting in the audience, not among the chorus). Quite simply, the singers, mostly amateurs, had never sounded better. The diction was faultless to a fare-thee-well and the cohesion with the orchestra and the Maestro total.\n\nThe fantastic finale was breathtaking ‚Äî there was a pause of a few seconds before the audience rose for a fortissimo-level standing ovation.\n\nIn effort to try to analyze technical things he did to achieve such dramatic effects, I noted that Gergiev eschewed both baton and a podium. Instead, he relied on his eyes, arms, hands and fingers, as well as rhythmic body movements, to transmit his intentions to the instrumentalists and the chorus. At brief times during rehearsal he used a small stylus, or pencil-size baton, but it was set aside while his fingers fluttered like butterflies whose wings seemed to re-create the inner pulses of the beat ‚Äî or, perhaps they were in sync with the violinists' left-hand vibrato on their instruments' strings. Whatever the reason for this unusual technique, its ultimate effect contributed mightily to the stunning results.\n\nThe same could be said about the kinetic use of his body. He often took an actual step toward whichever instrumental section he was cueing, and his conducting style often included rhythmic up-and-down, in-place body movements duplicating and transmitting sub-pulses within each beat.\n\n I asked some Yale and Cambridge singers to describe the experience.\n\n\"It was a total thrill,\" said one California-based Yale singer. \"He's aware of the tiniest sound we make.\"\n\nA Connecticut-based singer commented, \"During the rehearsals he seemed to be taking everything we did into his mind. Then, when it came time for the performance, he was able to get us to do just what he wanted. He was totally convincing. He gave us each cutoff and nuance. He required, and got, our total attention. We knew he would accept no less.\"\n\n\"He always seemed to be striving to an ideal,\" said another musician. \"It was as though he had an inner-recording of exactly how the composer wanted the piece, and an equally strong will that enabled him to transmit it to the musicians.\"\n\n An Alaska-based singer metaphorically summed up the Gergiev magic method: \"He\noesn't do spring-training or batting practice. He flies in for the big game and then gives his all ‚Äî and gets it.\"\n\n A New York City-based recent Yale graduate member of the chorus put it the most graphically. \"One of the reasons Gergiev is so significant is his intensity and emotive power as he conducts. He's the first conductor I've ever worked with, who, after the concert was over, had sweat so much that his tie, as well as his shirt, was wet through!\"\n\n![](/images/gergiev-freedom-banner.jpg)\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

[Additional material was added after attending the\nperformance of *To Hell and Back* in\nSan Francisco. This additional material was not printed in the ANG Newspapers.]\n\n\"THE marriage of words and music, and the way this union can tell the whole story ‚Äî including that which is not\nspoken ‚Äî inspires me,\" says [Jake Heggie](http://www.jakeheggie.com), the Bay Area's pre-eminent young\nresident composer. In so saying, Heggie is in harmony with the rarified company of Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann and\nRichard Wagner. All have had the near-magical gift of being able to meld words with music in such a way that words are\nendowed with great emotional color and significance. Often this rare musical skill adds a strong psychological dimension\nas well, thereby transporting mere words up to a profound level.\n\nHeggie, with the expert help of the Pacific Chorale and the Pacific Symphony, made such a thing happen on Sunday\n[November 5, 2006]\nat the sumptuous new Segerstrom Concert Hall in Orange County's Performing Arts Complex during the premiere of one of\nhis new works, *Seeking Higher Ground*, which he describes as \"a theater piece for chorus and orchestra.\"\n\n Bay Area audiences will likely experience more of the same this week when the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra\npremieres Heggie's latest work, a one-act opera for Baroque instruments, *To Hell and Back*, composed to a text\nby New York-based librettist Gene Scheer. Nicholas McGegan will conduct.\n\n As far as I know, this will represent Philharmonia Baroque's first musical foray into music of the 21st century.\nBut perhaps the group still has a figurative foot back in the 4th or 5th centuries B.C., as well. *To Hell and Back*\nturns out to be a modern-day variation on the tale of the Greek goddess Persephone, daughter of Demeter and Zeus,\nwho was abducted by Hades and taken to the underworld, thus depriving the world of springtime ‚Äî until a compromise\nwas reached.\n\n The Heggie-Greer adaptation is updated to our times by transposing elements of the old Greek myth into a depiction\nof the plight of many heroic women of our times as they deal with spousal abuse.\n\n During a conversation Heggie told me, \"When I'm composing, I strive for themes that will have resonance with\nmany people. I want my music to not only reflect my own thoughts, but to cross boundaries to universal issues and concerns.\"\n\n The production's stars include vocalists Isabel Bayrakdarian and Patti LuPone.\n\n Heggie is best known as the composer for the opera [\n*Dead Man Walking*](http://www.northworks.net/c_articles_deadman.htm), based on the novel by Sister Helen Prejean and libretto by Terrence McNally\n(also made into a movie starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn), which had its world premiere with the\nSan Francisco Opera in 2000. It has since been performed in major opera houses nationally and internationally;\nin September 2007, it will open in Vienna.\n\n Other works the prolific Heggie has written, the vast majority of which have been enthusiastically acclaimed by\ncritics and audiences alike, are the opera *The End of the Affair* to a libretto by Heather McDonald and Leonard\nFoglia and the musical scene *At the Statue of Venus*, again with a libretto by McNally.\n\n Besides being one of the most sought-after young composers in the world today, Heggie is also an accomplished concert\npianist, a perceptive writer, and an avid reader of great literature. His compositions have attracted some of the world's\nbest singers, many of whom have recorded and/or performed his many songs. Among them are Frederica von Stade, Renee\nFleming, Audra McDonald, Susan Graham and Bryn Terfel.\n\n Heggie, known as \"Jake,\" was born John Stephen Heggie in Palm Beach, Fla., in 1961. Soon after, his family\nmoved to Southern California and then on to Bexley, Ohio, where at age 6 he began piano lessons and at 12 launched\ninto composing. His father, who¬†was of Hungarian descent, was a medical doctor and played jazz saxophone. His mother\nwas a nurse. He has two older sisters and a younger brother.\n\n After graduating from high school, he traveled to Paris where he studied at the American University and the Paris\nConservatory of Music. But California's siren song beckoned, and eventually, he returned to UCLA where he studied with\nthe great American composer Roy Harris. It was during this period that he was awarded the Henry Mancini Prize for\ncomposition. One of his most recent major awards has been a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\n In comments Sunday to his Orange County audience, Heggie explained that *Seeking Higher Ground* was a\nresponse to Sister Helen Prejean's thoughts after dealing firsthand with the traumas of people in New Orleans during\nand after Hurricane Katrina. Amid the destruction, she attended a concert presented to these masses of suffering people\nby Bruce Springsteen. When he started singing the song \"We are climbing Jacob's ladder,\" she was deeply moved by how the\npeople were filled with hope and seemed to \"come together.\"\n\n Equally filled with feeling in response to her poem, Heggie crafted a piece that starts with a divided choir\nsinging music of an almost panicky character, and without a pitch center. He also requires heavy, rhythmic breathing\nby the choir as a dramatic, percussive device.\n\n Then the piece moves into storytelling mode and its emotional intensity escalates. The music forms a chillingly\napt frame for the ensuing words, \"Did you know the storm was comin'? Did you hear the people cry as they drowned? Did\nthey ever stand a chance? No money, no car, no hope of being found. Wading through the water. Seeking higher ground.\"\n\n \"Seeking higher ground\" repeats at key points thoughout the piece as the tension mounts. Then a sudden shift occurs\nas the second choir introduces *Jacob's Ladder*, with a quiet hum to portray the moments when Springsteen's song\nbrought the crowd together.\n\n By the end, both choirs are singing together, using all the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements of the piece\nat the same time, to create a huge climax of unity, harmony and hope.\n\n Sunday's audience responded in the inevitable way to such a surge of emotion by echoing with a standing ovation.\n\n I'll let you know the minute I find out a Bay Area performance date!\n\n [Added after the performance of *To Hell and Back*]\n\nAfter attending the San Francisco performance of *To Hell and Back* I am adding my views on this performance\nto the contents of my column printed in the ANG Newspapers prior to the performance.\n\nJake Heggie's One Act Opera, *To Hell and Back*, is both rhythmically and harmonically powerful, augmented\nby the period instruments' mellower-than-modern sounds, so as to mold a piece that is poignant, yet pungent.\nScheer's libretto imbues the piece with the linguistic color and punch of our age, grafted onto thematic material\nfrom Greek mythology typically used for operas in the Baroque period. The combination achieves a multi-level\ncontemporary-plus-classic impact rare in new operatic offerings - perhaps one has to go back to Benjamin Britten\nfor comparable achievement.\n\nPatty LuPone was right on the mark in her role as Anne, the wise, high-mileage older woman. She created a\ncutting counterpoint to Isabel Bayrakderian's beautiful, beleaguered Persephone by morphing into a seasoned, but\nbruised woman who was willing to stick her neck on the chopping block so that an Innocent would not have to suffer\nas she evidently had. Her so-called \"Broadway\" intonation and style of delivery created a brilliant,\nperfectly natural musical vehicle to drive that point into the sensibilities of the audience - vividly, and most\neffectively as drama in the intimate venue of Herbst, which has a seating capacity similar to most Broadway\ntheaters.\n\nJake Heggie has matured into one of the leading music drama composers of this age. While some of my colleagues\namong the Bay Area's music critics do not seem to agree with my evaluation, I believe Heggie's achievements will\neclipse those of most other contemporary composers, and hopefully, will endure through the ages.\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

So, it's time to start stretching and exercising the old vocal cords. After all, it takes a certain degree of vocal fitness to hit all the notes and properly sing our nation's signature song.\n\nOur National Anthem's stirring words can speed up our pulses and bring tears to our eyes -- but its melody strains most American vocal cords to capacity. Think how many of us drop out on the line that begins \"and the rockets' red glare....\" The reason is that the word \"glare\" and the word \"free\" in the last line both require a vocal leap 12 notes higher than the song's lowest note -- a mighty stretch for most of us.\n\nFrancis Scott Key, a chap who was born in Frederick, Maryland in 1779, is responsible for the words. But the tune to which Key matched his words' meter was *To Anacreon in Heaven*, a piece composed about 1780 as the official song of the Anacreontic Society, a British social and musical organization. Key must have been a pretty good singer with a broad range, since he had used the same tune back in 1805 to accompany another of his poems, an ode to honor Commodore Stephen Decatur.\n\nAlthough he was indeed considered a fine poet, by 1805 he had established a law practice in Georgetown Maryland. By 1814, he had appeared many times before the U.S. Supreme Court. His brother-in-law, Roger Brooke Taney, was eventually named as the Supreme Court's Chief Justice and as such, administered the oath of office to Abraham Lincoln in 1861.\n\nBut Key's enduring place in the history of our country was secured when he set his patriotic passion into verse after watching the British onslaught of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812.\n\nAccording to the historical record, Key's friend, Dr. William Beanes, was taken prisoner by the British army soon after its departure from Washington in August of 1814. Key left for Baltimore to obtain the services of Colonel John Skinner, the government's prisoner-of-war exchange agent, to aid him in securing the release of Dr. Beanes. Together they sailed on a truce ship down the bay and met the British fleet.\n\nThey successfully negotiated the doctor's release, but all three were then detained by the British until after the attack on Baltimore. Key stood watch through the night from the deck of a British ship anchored about eight miles below the fort during its bombardment.\n\nIt was from this site that, \"the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\" finally gave him \"proof through the night\" that the flag was indeed \"still there,\" flying high and victorious, over the fort. During the night, the British had fired nearly 1,800 bombs, rockets and shells at the Fort, with about 400 of them landing inside. As the day's early light dawned, Key penned his feelings of thrill and relief on the back of an envelope.\n\nAs the British fleet withdrew, Key and his cohorts were sent ashore. The next day, in a hotel, he made a good copy of his poem and showed it to some of his wife's Baltimore relatives. They immediately had it printed and distributed throughout the city on a handbill entitled \"The Defense of Fort McHenry.\"\n\nA couple of weeks later it was published in Baltimore newspapers, and under the name, *The Star-Spangled Banner*, gained enthusiastic popularity. An actor-singer then sang it, using the English tune to which Key had matched its meter, at a public performance.\n\nDuring the Civil War, with both Union and Confederate forces rallying to its strains, Key's creation became nationally popular. However, it took several more decades, another war, and the Great Depression for it to be named the official anthem of the United States. President Herbert Hoover signed the Congressional bill proposing that it be so, into law on March 3, 1931.\n\nThere were, and have remained to this day, other musical contenders for the honor of National Anthem. Among them are *America the Beautiful*, *Yankee Doodle*, *God Bless America*, *America* (aka *God Save the Queen*), all of which, for average folks, seem a little more singable.\n\nHowever, none better capture the fervor of America's great promise, to remain \"the land of the free and the home of the brave!\" than does *The Star-Spangled Banner*. Perhaps the difficult range of notes through which we must struggle in order to sing it remind us of the difficulties through which we must struggle to maintain the United States as the honorable land of the free and the home of the brave!\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **National Symphony Orchestra Plays Music from the 1940s**\n**\n*Classical Music Column for the ANG Newspapers Preview Section for February 11, 2005, under headline,*\n\n#### Different sort of 40s tunes from National Symphony\n\nFUNNY thing, time. What was once new and exciting often becomes old and ' uh, well ' dull. But if you wait just a few more years, the tables turn and the old and dull take on a new sense of chic, and sometimes, even distinct value.\nSo it is with a timely project focusing on American arts during the 1940s. Now playing at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the project sports the title, A New America: The 1940s and the Arts ** and involves ballet, jazz programs, pop concerts, theater productions and more. It started in January and continues through June.\n\nSaturday, while in the capital for a few days, I heard a National Symphony Orchestra portion of the project. Conducted by the eminent Leonard Slatkin, the concert featured Virgil Thomson's *Fugue and Chorale on Yankee Doodle,* adapted by the composer in 1967 from music he had written in 1945; Paul Creston's *Frontiers,* composed in 1943; Erich Korngold's 1946 *Concerto in D for Violin and Orchestra*; Elliott Carter's 1945 piece inspired by and named for Emily Dickinson's poem *Musicians Wrestle Everywhere* and William Schuman's bumptious 1941 *Symphony No. 3*.\n\nEven though the concert was a continent's width away, it has relevance to us in the Bay Area. After all, the National Symphony was founded in 1931 to be the whole country's orchestra. It's composed of 100 musicians who play a 52-week season of some 175 concerts, including performances for state occasions and for heads of state as well as excursions and outreach.\n\nAccording to Maestro Slatkin, music of the 1940s was far more than Benny Goodman's big band swing, Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra's signature crooning, Dinah Shore's silky song renditions or the Andrews Sisters' peppy presentations.\n\nThe decade also was a time when significant numbers of musicians, artists, writers and pedagogues immigrated to\n\nAmerica as refugees from Hitler's Nazi regime. While many remained on the East Coast, many flowed into Lake Hollywood, where they could find employment as studio musicians, technicians, artists and writers.\n\nOne of the most interesting was Erich Korngold. Born in Brno, Moravia in 1897, he died a world away in Hollywood in 1957. In Europe, Korngold had become a sensation. His first opera, *The Snowman*, was composed at age 11 and was produced by the Vienna Opera.\n\nLater, the most successful of his 19 operas, *Die Tote Stadt* (\"The Dead City\"), was given a simultaneous premiere in Hamburg and Cologne, and a year later at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\nIn the 1930s, he immigrated to Hollywood where he was set to work on musical scores for movies. He eventually composed 17 scores for Warner Bros. films, two of which won Academy Awards. The dashing musical score accompanying Errol Flynn's first great hit, \"The Sea Hawk,\" as well as compelling scores to the poignant Bette Davis/Paul Muni/Brian Aherne flick \"Juarez,\" \"Anthony Adverse\" and \"The Prince and the Pauper,\" are all Korngold's.\n\nIn Europe, Korngold had been considered a peer by Richard Strauss, Karl Goldmark and Giacomo Puccini. In the United States, he joined the ranks of Jascha Heifetz (for whom his Violin Concerto was composed), Miklos Rozsa, Franz Waxman, Morton Gould and more.\n\nContemporary violinist Leonidas Kavakos used his 1692 \"Falmouth\" Stradivarius instrument to perform the Korngold Concerto with Slatkin and the National Symphony last Saturday eve. By turns rousing, passionate and achingly bittersweet, the work's themes were actually pirated by Korngold from segments of several of his own film scores. Kavakos, Slatkin and the orchestra did credit to Korngold's memory and contributed mightily to the musical heritage of his adopted new country.\n\nAlthough my companions and I were initially expecting to merely endure the Thomson, Creston and Schumann works, we actually became enthusiastically engaged by the collective wit, color, creativity and depth of these vintage 1940 works.\n\nFor those who might be touring the grand sights in D.C. soon, be sure to take in a National Symphony Orchestra concert.\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **San Francisco Conservatory of Music Ensemble Parallele's Production of Wozzeck at the Yerba Buena Center**\n**\n*Classical Music Column for the ANG Newspapers Preview Section for January 26, 2010, under headline,* Berg's *Wozzeck* is still powerful after 85 years****\n\nThe music, art and architecture of a given time often present a mirror image of the mood and mores of that time. As a potent example of this thesis, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music's resident Ensemble Parallele, under the direction of its founder and conductor Nicole Paiement, is preparing to recreate the reeling Weltanschauung of 1920s Europe this weekend with a production of Austrian-born Alban Berg's fervid opera, *Wozzeck.*\n\nAccording to Paiement, a petite, ballerina-like blonde with a French accent, Ensemble Parallele, founded in 1994, is dedicated to presenting contemporary chamber opera. She will conduct the upcoming *Wozzeck* production, a reorchestration of Berg's 1925 original by Montreal composer John Rea. Director Brian Staufenbiel's film noir staging uses multimedia projections by media artist Austin Forbord that are reminiscent of German silent films of the 1920s.\n\nA down and out guy**\n\nThe cast of impressively polished singers will be headed by the superlative singing actor, bass-baritone Bojan Knezevic, as Wozzeck, an honorable but victimized soldier/servant who represents the \"arme Leut\" (tragic common man). Marie, Wozzeck's common-law wife and mother of his child, will be sung by Patricia Green, a soprano with a three-octave range.\n\nSinging the role of the pompously ruthless Captain will be powerful tenor John Duykers; AJ Glueckert will\nsing the braggadocio role of the Drum Major, who seduces Marie and taunts Wozzeck in front of his fellow soldiers before beating him up. Phillip Skinner, a versatile bass-baritone, will sing the role of the doctor who has recruited Wozzeck as a guinea pig for his medical experiments; J. Raymond Meyers, a tenor with an astonishing range, will portray Andres, Wozzeck's friend. Erin Neff will sing the role of Margret; bass John Bischoff is the First Apprentice and Hawaii-born baritone Torlef Borsting the Second Apprentice.\n\n*Wozzeck* was ‚Äî and still is ‚Äî a work of art that can jolt human sensibilities about as much as a powerful earthquake can jog up the Richter scale. But by no means will it be opera as usual ‚Äî the kind brimming with soaring, beautiful melody and cushioned by lush instrumental harmonies. Rather, *Wozzeck* is related to the often lurid Expressionistic movement of art and music that followed on the heels of the sparkling, light-drenched style dubbed Impressionism.\n\nImpressionist composers such as Debussy and painters such as Monet sought to represent their impressions of people, scenes and objects of the external world in a descriptively kinetic, pictorial sense ‚Äî colored by graceful melody and pleasing harmony.\n\nAlthough practitioners of both stylistic disciplines characterized real objects and persons, Expressionists depicted them in distorted, tension-ridden, often fragmented images or sounds. Painters such as Ernst Kirchner smothered their subjects in thick, saturated colors, often further imprisoning them within slashing, angular black lines. Faces sometimes emerged as blank blobs of paint that look as though they were applied by a knife spreading cheese on a cracker.\n\nComposer Berg, in company with his Expressionistic colleagues, employed exaggerated dynamics, a plethora of tritones and distorted vocal inflections (a sort of talk-sing style called Sprechstimme that sounds like the filmed portrayals of Marley's Ghost from Dickens' *A Christmas Carol*). Other sonic weapons they used were jagged, wide-leaping melodic passages; dissonant, atonal harmonies; and complex, intentionally unstable-sounding rhythmic patterns. Such elements were recruited to express the dark inner feelings of personalities psychologists have characterized as either distressed, helpless entities flailing about in the grip of forces they do not understand, or as the isolated prey of their own inner anxieties and irrational subconscious drives.\n\n**Goose bumps galore**\n\nAnd there, stuffed into a rather contorted nutshell, you have the world that faced the first half of the 20th century as well as the tragic title character of Berg's potent opera, *Wozzeck* ‚Äî a character that Knezevic portrayed with chilling intensity during the rehearsal I attended.\n\nBe assured: Despite Berg's sallies into Expressionistic shock, the upcoming \"Wozzeck\" is bound to awe you with an emotional force you will neither regret nor forget. (Although its original audiences often walked out mid-performance or even rioted, within its first 10 years, *Wozzeck* was performed more than 150 times in 28 European cities.)\n\n![](/images/logos-newspaper.gif)\n\n",
