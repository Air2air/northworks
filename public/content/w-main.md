Dr. North has served as a member and consultant to the Science Advisory Board of the US Environmental Protection Agency since 1978, and as a Presidentially appointed member of the US Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (1989-1994). Dr. North is a co-author of many reports dealing with environmental risk for the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, including Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process* (1983), *Improving Risk Communication* (1989), *Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment* (1994), *Understanding Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society* (1996), and *Public Participation in Environmental Assessment and Decision Making* (2008).

Dr. North was a member of the Board on Radioactive Waste Management of the National Research Council from 1995 until 1999. He was the chair for the steering and advisory committees for the International Workshop on the Disposition of High-Level Radioactive Waste, held November 4-5, 1999, and leading to the report, * Disposition of High-Level Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel: The Continuing Societal and Technical Challenges,* published in June 2001.

Dr. North is a past president (1991-92) of the international Society for Risk Analysis, a recipient of the Frank P. Ramsey Medal from the Decision Analysis Society in 1997 for lifetime contributions to the field of decision analysis, and the 1999 recipient of the Outstanding Risk Practitioner Award from the Society for Risk Analysis.

Dr. North received his Ph.D. in operations research from Stanford University and his B.S. in physics from Yale University.

#### Sustainable Fuel Cycle Task Force

Dr. North serves as a member of the Science Panel of this group, which was established following the Obama Administration's actions to curtail further activity on the proposed repository for high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Information on the Task Force and its Science Panel has been available on its website (sustainablefuelcyclesciencepanel.org, which should be online again soon).

The Science Panel has sent letters, most recently to Secretary of Energy Perry [(letter dated November 14, 2017)](science panel ltr to secretary perry- 17-11-14.pdf), and previously to him as the nominee for Secretary, [(letter dated January 23, 2017)](science panel ltr to governor perry-17-01-23 final.pdf) recommending that he make one of his highest priorities the restarting of the Yucca Mountain licensing process. (The links above are to these letters as pdf files.)

#### Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future

Warner North testified before the House Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, Feb 1, 2012 on the Blue Ribbon Commission's Final Report to the Secretary of Energy. A perspective article based on this testimony was published in Risk Analysis* January 2013: "Can Sisyphus Succeed? Getting U.S. High-Level Nuclear Waste into a Geological Repository," Risk Analysis 33**(1):2-14, 2013.**

Warner North was an invited participant at the meeting of the Disposal Subcommittee of the Commission in Washington, D.C. on September 1, 2010. This presentation to the Blue Ribbon Commission was as an individual invited by the Commission, and not connected with his activities with the Sustainable Fuel Cycle Task Force Science Panel. Similarly, his testimony to the House Subcommittee on February 1, 2012 was as an individual invited by the Subcommittee.

#### Society for Risk Analysis

In April 2008 Dr. North became the Area Editor for decision sciences for [*Risk Analysis*, an international journal](http://www.sra.org/journal editors.php), published by the Society for Risk Analysis.

Dr. North organized and wrote the introduction for a [ special issue published September 2016 on health risk analysis for criteria air pollutants](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.2016.36.issue-9/issuetoc). He has written an introductory commentary for a survey article on risk from space weather. Both the article and the introduction are in press for the February 2017 issue.

His book review of five more books of interest to the risk analysis community was published in the February 2014 issue of *Risk Analysis*: Marc Gerstein, *Flirting with Disaster: Why Accidents Are Rarely Accidental*, Nancy G. Leveson, *Engineering a Safer World: Systems Thinking Applied to Safety*, Nate Silver, *The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail but Some Don't*, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, *Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder*, James Owen Weatherall, *The Physics of Wall Street: A Brief History of Predicting the Unpredictable*. (At the Society for Risk Analysis Annual Meeting in December 2014, Dr. North was given an award as "best book reviewer.")

The July 2012 issue of *Risk Analysis* features a profile of Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. Dr. North's review of Professor Kahneman's book, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (plus two other related books on risk from the viewpoint of cognitive psychology) is in this issue.

Dr. North's comments on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill appear in the SRA [RISK Newsletter, 3rd Quarter 2010](http://www.sra.org/newsletter/risk.v30.n3.pdf), page 6, as part of a series of comments by SRA past presidents.
