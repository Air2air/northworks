THE RELATIONSHIP between San Francisco Symphony conductor Michael Tilson Thomas with the music of Gustav Mahler is much like the relationship between flint and steel. When the two get together, things heat up and sparks fly. It's happened before and it happened again when MTT stepped in front of the massed army of San Francisco Symphony musicians on Davies Symphony Hall's stage Wednesday evening in San Francisco.

The concert, highlighted by Mahler's milestone Symphony No. 5, was the first of four performances this week from which live-recorded materials will be assembled into a CD to be issued sometime next year as part of the Symphony's ongoing Mahler recording project.
