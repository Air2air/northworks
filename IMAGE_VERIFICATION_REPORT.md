## Remaining Issues

### Missing Images (9 remaining)
These images are referenced in JSON files but do not exist in the `public/images` directory:

1. **SAB Figures (Warner Background)** - 3 images:
   - `/images/1990-sab-figure1.jpg`
   - `/images/1990-sab-figure2.jpg`
   - `/images/1990-sab-figure3.jpg`

2. **Interview Images** - 4 images:
   - `/images/hvorostovsky-sb08.jpg` (alternatives: `hvorostovsky.jpg`, `thm-hvorostovsky.jpg`, `title-hvorostovsky.gif`)
   - `/images/kissine-with-wife-and-c-3-4-10.jpg`
   - `/images/russell-braun.jpg`
   - `/images/thibaudet-wandc.jpg` (alternatives: `thibaudet1.jpg`, `thm-thibaudet.jpg`)

3. **Review Images** - 1 image:
   - `/images/stuttgart-state-opera.jpg`

4. **Publication Images** - 1 image:
   - `/images/wnstuttgart10-04.jpg`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Source Missing Images**: The 9 remaining missing images should be located from original sources or archives
2. **Alternative Image Selection**: For some images, suitable alternatives exist in the directory and could be used
3. **Content Review**: Review the content items with missing images to determine if they're critical for display

### Alternative Options for Missing Images
- **Hvorostovsky**: Use `/images/hvorostovsky.jpg` or `/images/thm-hvorostovsky.jpg`
- **Thibaudet**: Use `/images/thibaudet1.jpg` or `/images/thm-thibaudet.jpg`
- **Stuttgart Opera**: Use generic opera-related image like `/images/opera-now-cover.jpg`

### Asset Management
1. **Unused Images**: 172 image files (65% of total) are not referenced in JSON data
2. **Consider cleanup**: Review unused images to remove outdated/unnecessary files
3. **Naming conventions**: Implement consistent naming patterns (many thumbnail images use `thm-` prefix)

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Results
- **91.1% success rate** - Very high percentage of working image references
- **10 automatic corrections** - Successfully matched alternative image files
- **Improved data integrity** - Reduced broken image references by 52.6% (19 → 9)

### Remaining Concerns
- **SAB Scientific Figures**: All 3 scientific figure images are missing from `warner-background.json`
- **Interview Archive**: Some interview images may be from older archives and harder to locate
- **Content Display**: Missing images may impact user experience on affected pages

## Technical Details

### Tools Used
- Custom Python verification script (`verify_images.py`)
- Automated path correction script (`fix_image_paths.py`)
- Pattern matching for similar filenames
- Bulk find/replace operations using `sed`

### File Patterns Discovered
- Thumbnail images: `thm-[name].jpg`
- Logo images: `logo-[organization].gif`
- Title images: `title-[name].gif`
- Mixed naming conventions for full-size images

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Locate and add the 3 SAB scientific figures for `warner-background.json`
2. **Priority 2**: Source missing interview images or select appropriate alternatives
3. **Priority 3**: Review unused image files for potential cleanup
4. **Priority 4**: Implement consistent naming conventions for future images

## Conclusion

The image verification process has significantly improved the website's data integrity, achieving over 91% success rate for image references. The automated corrections resolved most common naming mismatches, leaving only 9 images that require manual intervention or sourcing.
