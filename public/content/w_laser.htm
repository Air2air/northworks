                    <h3>Sustainable Fuel Cycle Task Force</h3>
                    
Dr. North serves as a member of the Science Panel of this group, which was established following the Obama Administration's actions to curtail further activity on the proposed repository for high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Information on the Task Force and its Science Panel has been available on its website (sustainablefuelcyclesciencepanel.org, which should be online again soon).</p>
                    
The Science Panel has sent letters, most recently to Secretary of Energy Perry <a href="Science Panel Ltr to Secretary Perry- 17-11-14.pdf">(letter dated November 14, 2017)</a>, and previously to him as the nominee for Secretary, <a href="Science Panel Ltr to Governor Perry-17-01-23 FINAL.pdf">(letter dated January 23, 2017)</a> recommending that he make one of his highest priorities the restarting of the Yucca Mountain licensing process. (The links above are to these letters as PDF files.)</p>
