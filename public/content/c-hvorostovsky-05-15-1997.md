title: Dmitri Hvorostovsky - Voice of the Century?
type: interview
---

There will be an opportunity this week to welcome the San Francisco Symphony back from the successes of its recent European Tour and to check out a rumor. A number of people who have heard the young Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, have acclaimed him as having a voice that only happens about once a century.

Hvorostovsky will appear, along with the beautiful Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, with the Symphony, under the baton of guest conductor Mario Bernardi, in concerts at 8 p.m. May 24, 26, and 27 at Davies Symphony Hall, corner of Van Ness Avenue and Grove Street, San Francisco. The two will perform selections from Donizetti's 'La Favorita,'

Rossini's 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia,' Saint-Saens' 'Samson et Delila,' Rimsky-Korsakov's 'The Tsar's Bride,' as well as various operatic solos.

It won't be the 32-year-old baritone's first trip to San Francisco, however. During a telephone interview from his New York hotel room last Monday, he explained in fluent, barely accented English. 'I came to San Francisco about six years ago to sing with a group called 'Beyond War.' It's one of my favorite cities - and as many Russians, I'm very nostalgic and want to return. It was my first United States City.'

He also explained his English proficiency. 'During my trips to the United States, I usually stayed with Americans who did not speak Russian. I had to chat with them every night after my concerts.' 'And then, of course,' he continued, 'I bought a house in London where my wife Svetlana (a ballerina) and I have been living for the past year. This too has helped my English.'

Hvorostovsky was born in Krasnoyarsk, an industrial/scientific center in Siberia with a population of over a million. An only child, his father is a chemical engineer and his mother, a doctor. 'I'm a little bit spoiled,' he said. 'My parents both worked, so I was raised by my grandmother, who spoiled and cherished me. I miss her a lot, but Thank God, she is still living.'
Although his father has not officially retired, he, like many of his scientist/engineer colleagues in the new Russia Federation, is presently unemployed. 'My father hasn't received a pay (check) for about a half year. He hasn't got money, but Thank God, he's got me,' said Dmitri. 'I can
send him and my family money from my concerts.'

Since the elder Hvorostovsky hasn't been working as an engineer lately, he has resumed his singing career. Also a baritone, he performed a recital series in Italy last summer. Says Dmitri, 'My father studied music mostly by himself and he is very good. As far back as I can remember, I was always watching and listening to him doing his vocal exercises. I took every opportunity to learn from him.'

'There was never any conflict about what I wanted to be when I grew up,' he continued. 'I always wanted to be in music. I was bad at math, Russian, and literature. I used to play soccer and liked boxing and swimming. I guess I was somewhat of a wild boy. But through it all, I
loved music.'

He attended the Krasnoyarsk High School of Arts where he studied with voice with Yekaterina Yofel and took classes in music theory, conducting and piano. After seven years, his piano playing became so proficient that he won a first prize for a performance of the Gershwin Preludes. 'After that I began winning many competitions in voice ' always first prizes,' he emphasized.

Hvorostovsky met Borodina eight years ago when both were first prize winners in the Glinka Competition in the Soviet Union. Although they subsequently went different ways, they remained close friends and occasionally met when their touring or recording schedules overlapped. It was during a recent recording session with Philips that they hit on the
idea of performing concerts together.

Hvorostovsky is not shy about his strong points, nor does he deny his vocal limitations. 'I have very good breath control,' he says. 'That is one of my major strengths and it allows me to sing pianissimo in the high register. But I'm five years away from singing Wagner's Ring. Verdi also
comes later.'

Meanwhile, he maintains a daunting touring and recording schedule. This next year he will sing Figaro in San Francisco's production of 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia,' Valentin in Gounod's 'Faust' with the Chicago Lyric Opera, and 'Pique Dame' at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In concert he will appear with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he hopes to
do a Mahler song cycle, and in concerts at Carnegie Hall, Washington, D.C., Fort Worth, Oslo, London, Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Munich, Basel, Paris, Lyon and Glasgow.

Among the recordings he already has to his credit (all Philips Classics) are 'Yevgeny Onegin' with Semyon Bychov, 'La Traviata' with Kiri te Kanawa, Alredo Kraus, and Zubin Mehta, and 'Cavalleria Rusticana' with Jessye Norman, as well two albums of Romances by Russian composers, two albums of operatic arias by Russian and Italian composers, and a
soon-to-be-released album of bel canto arias by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. He has done a massively successful cross-over recording of Russian folk songs with folk orchestra called 'Dark Eyes' that hit the top of the charts in Europe.

And yes' I did say he was just 32!
