Warner North\n\n     The possibility that global climate may be altered as the result of a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been acknowledged within the scientific community for many years, although it has only recently emerged as a major issue of environmental policy. To facilitate better understanding of this issue, the U.S. Congress asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prepare two special reports to Congress, one on the effects of global climate alteration and the other on alternatives to stabilize the concentrations of radiatively active, or greenhouse, gases in the atmosphere. The first of these reports, *The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change in the United States* (EPA, 1988), was issued in draft form in October, 1988 and in final form December 1989 (EPA, 1989a). The second report, *Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate *(EPA, 1989b) was issued in draft in February, 1989. Both reports were reviewed in public meetings by the Global Climate Change Subcommittee of EPA's Science Advisory Board (Science Advisory Board, 1989a, 1989b). The final version of the second report is now in preparation.\n\nThe reports are valuable initial efforts to summarize the available science and assess the implications of scientific knowledge for policy decision making by the United States Government and by other nations, organizations, and individuals. They provide a preliminary basis for assessing the implications of the scientific knowledge now available on global climate change and its consequences, and on policy options for mitigating these consequences and for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Neither report attempts to assess the economic and social costs associated with policy choices, so that EPA's work must be regarded as only an initial step in formulating policy options.\n\nThe data collected on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958 clearly illustrates how the composition of the atmosphere is changing. Increases in atmospheric concentration are also occurring for the other major greenhouse gases: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and tropospheric ozone (O3). The composition and radiative properties of the atmosphere are being altered by human activities; on this point there is essentially no uncertainty. What science cannot provide today is a clear projection of what these atmospheric alterations imply. We do not understand regional and global climate well enough to forecast very accurately how the changes in the atmosphere will lead to changes in climate, and how these changes in climate will affect the biosphere and human activities.\n\nFor its analysis of potential effects in the United States EPA has made use of three general circulation models (GCMs). These complex models of the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere represent the state of the scientific art in climate prediction. The GCMs show moderately good agreement in predicting average temperature changes over broad geographic regions. The models show much less agreement in predicting changes in precipitation, and they have little or no capability to predict changes in extreme weather events — droughts, frosts, severe storms — that may be of great importance in assessing the impacts of climate change on the biosphere.\n\nSome parties contend that the uncertainties in predicting the extent and character of climate change are so great at this time that attempts to assess the consequences of the altered composition of the atmosphere have little usefulness. The SAB disagreed with this position and endorsed the approach take by EPA. The assessment and planning process should not be deterred by large uncertainties, which arise in large part from the present lack of understanding of natural variations in climate. The GCMs may not provide much better predictions than simple radiation balance calculations or more highly simplified models, such as EPA used in its *Stabilizing *Report. But predictions from these different models can illustrate the range of uncertainty in potential climate change, and show how this range is altered as we look further forward in time, assuming various levels of emissions of the greenhouse gases. We can then examine policy alternatives for emissions reduction, mitigation of consequences, and research initiatives in the context of these uncertainties.\n\nThe EPA *Effects* Report**\n\nThe EPA Potential Effects report presents a good overview of a complex subject. Of the nineteen chapters, ten discuss various types of effects for the United States as a whole: water resources, sea level rise, agriculture, forests, biological diversity, air quality, human health, urban infrastructure, energy demand, and climate variability. Four chapters present assessments of effects for geographical regions: California, the Southeast, the Great Lakes Region, and the Northern Great Plains. The remaining chapters describe the methodology used and provide a summary of implications for research and policy. The SAB review concluded that EPA had accomplished a commendable effort of translating the available information into an assessment of the potential impacts in the United States of climate change resulting from altering the composition of the atmosphere. **\n\nThe SAB Subcommittee judged that these potential impacts are clearly cause for the Congress and the American public to be concerned. In some regions and for some ecological systems (forests, wetlands) the effects of climate change could be severe, and the *Effects* Report indicates where the United States appears to be most vulnerable. But the magnitude and timing of these effects suggest that a determined effort should allow the United States to adapt to most of them. Moreover, the report suggests that the cost of adaptation, while it may be large in absolute terms, will be relatively small if measured as a fraction of the United States economy over a time period of fifty years to a century. This conclusion is necessarily weak, because the current understanding of the global climate system is so limited, and there is a clear and immediate need to improve our scientific understanding. The report suggests that global climate change presents the United States with a problem that is substantial in terms of its potential demand for planning and for economic and technical resources, but not overwhelming in magnitude compared to the other long-term national and international problems that Congress must address in the last decade of this century.\n\nThe effects outside of the United States and in the time period beyond the next century may be cause for greater concern. As Lave and Vickland (1989) and others have pointed out, developing nations depending on subsistence agriculture and nations with large areas lying close to sea level may be threatened far more seriously than the United States. The indirect effects on the United States of disruption in other parts of the world caused by climate alteration may be as severe as any of the direct effects portrayed in the EPA draft report. Further, the time period of EPA's assessment may be too short. Alteration of the atmosphere might result in commitment to a long-term climatic shift that over a period of many centuries causes the melting of a substantial fraction of polar ice — implying a sea-level rise of much more than the one to two meters considered in the *Effects* Report. The result would be flooding (or protection by massive seawalls at great expense) of the coastal cities that contain much of the world's cultural heritage.\n\n     In selecting emission reduction policies, the full set of uncertain consequences of greenhouse gas emissions should be weighed against the problems of achieving emissions reduction. It seems clear that effects assessment needs to be extended to other countries and to consequences that may occur beyond the year 2100.\n\nThe EPA *Stabilizing* Report**\n\n     The second EPA draft report to Congress, *Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate*, examines policies for altering emissions of greenhouse gases. The initial chapters of the report summarize current scientific information on the response to increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and on technologies and processes associated with greenhouse gas emissions. While some discussion of individual policy options is presented in the final chapters, the core of the report is the scenario analysis. This analysis provides worldwide projections of the emissions of greenhouse gases out to the year 2100 under plausible future scenarios and examines the effect of policy on climate over this time period.\n**\n\nThe EPA used a methodology based on simplified, integrated models to generate scenarios for climate change to examine the impact of stabilizing policies. To assess the consequences of alteration of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere, EPA used a relatively simple parametrized model whose output was globally averaged temperature. Regional variations in temperature, precipitation, and extreme climatic events may be more appropriate measures of climate change impacts, but forecasts of such impacts are at present extremely imprecise. Global average temperature change is an index for climate change that allows stabilizing policies to be compared.\n\nAs input for the climate model EPA developed emissions projections of the five greenhouse gases over time based on assumptions and judgment about population growth, economic growth, and the technologies and processes associated with greenhouse gas emissions. These factors are highly uncertain and complex, especially the projection of the demand for and availability of technologies and processes on a worldwide basis to the year 2100. By organizing its analysis around a small number of scenarios, EPA was able to aggregate across the complexity of the technologies and processes while illustrating the uncertainty in projected emissions, the resulting climate impacts, and the potential effect of policy in reducing these impacts.\n\nDescription of the scenarios and results for globally averaged temperature as an index of climate change results are presented in more detail by Lashof (1991). Two sets of assumptions were used for population growth, which EPA called the Slowly Changing World (SCW) and the Rapidly Changing World (RCW). For each of these sets of population and economic growth assumptions EPA projected emissions with and without a package of policy options to reduce emissions. The scenarios without the policy option package are denoted SCW and RCW, and the scenarios with the emissions reduction policy package are denoted SCWP and RCWP. In addition, EPA ran a large number of sensitivity analysis cases to examine variations from these four scenarios. In revising the EPA draft report subsequent to SAB review, two of the sensitivity cases became additional scenarios. One of these is a variation on RCW with even higher levels of emissions, denoted RCWA. The other was a variation on RCWP with more stringent policy options to accomplish rapid reduction in emissions, denoted RCWR.\n\n     EPA's scenario approach permits examination of the relative contributions of the different gases, economics sectors, and regions to global warming. For the four scenarios in the draft report the relative contribution to warming by 2100 by carbon dioxide is 66 to 73%; most of these emissions are from energy use rather than deforestation, so that fossil fuel consumption is the dominant contributor to climate change.\n\nIt is instructive to examine the relationship between population projections, projections of end-use fuel demands, and use of primary energy materials for the policy and non-policy cases that EPA has considered. The population projections by region used by EPA for the SCW and RCW scenarios and their policy derivatives are shown in Figure 1. It is evident that in both scenarios the population increase occurs outside of the OECD countries (the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). Figure 2 shows the pattern of end-use fuel demand by region. The proportion of energy end use in the OECD countries decreases considerably over time, and the extent of energy end use saving from policy is much larger outside the OECD countries than within them. The rate of carbon dioxide emissions is driven primarily by the pattern of energy use in the non-OECD countries as the non-OECD countries develop and industrialize. Figure 3 shows primary energy supply by type. In the non-policy cases, annual worldwide coal consumption expands from three to ten times the present level, while in the policy cases worldwide coal use stays approximately constant. To accomplish the necessary substitution for coal requires the creation of very large industries for the new energy technologies, such as biomass, photovoltaics and other solar, nuclear and conservation/increased energy efficiency.\n\nThe two scenarios added by EPA respond to criticisms from the SAB review. First, EPA had not addressed the task assigned it by Congress to look at policies to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The RCWR scenario does involve stabilization in the next century, but this scenario will be much more difficult and costly to implement than those in SCWP and RCWP. Second, SAB suggested that the assumptions in the non-policy scenarios SCW and RCW might include overly optimistic projections on increases of energy efficiency in end-use applications and in the availability of alternate (non-fossil) sources of energy. Examination of these two additional scenarios will indicate that the magnitude of changes in the energy sector could be much larger than the comparison illustrated in Figure 3.\n\nThe SAB review commended EPA for its approach and noted that the report represents, to SAB's knowledge, the most comprehensive effort to date to carry out such an assessment. It is a valuable initial effort that provides important insights and a basis for further refinement. EPA's approach provides a systematic and comprehensive accounting of energy supply and demand as these evolve over time, by region, and under different assumptions for policy.\n\nThe SAB identified as a major weakness the lack of detailed documentation for the models, the extensive data base, and the details of the results (e.g., energy quantities and prices over time) for the scenarios examined. Additional documentation has been prepared by EPA and will presumably be available when the final version of the report is issued.\n\nRefinement of the EPA work in future analysis will be highly valuable. In future work it will be desirable to expand the most important aspects of the model (use of coal versus substitutes including conservation) and examine factors determining technology choice rather than aggregate elasticities. The Stanford Energy Modeling Forum is just beginning a two-year effort to examine models for projecting energy sector impacts and costs of various measures to control greenhouse gas emissions (Energy Modeling Forum, 1990).\n\nAnother SAB criticism of the draft report was that the chapters providing an overview of policy options were overly focused on near-term alternatives for limiting energy use. More emphasis is needed on energy R&D and commercialization options and examination of means to facilitate emissions reduction in the non-OECD countries that are consistent with the aspirations of these countries for energy development and economic growth.\n\nImplications for Policy and Research Needs**\n\nStabilization of the atmosphere may be possible only in the next century, at concentrations of greenhouse gases that may alter climate in significant ways, and then only as the result of a great effort by many nations involving high levels of innovation and substantial costs. Given the potential for climate alteration from emissions up to the present and during the next few decades, some degree of adaptation to an altered climate may be unavoidable. EPA's analysis indicates potential for global climate changes by the end of the 21st century ranging from modest to large, with a potential commitment to even larger climate changes in the succeeding century. The policies examined by EPA in scenarios SCWP and RCWP, as representative of those needed to stabilize emission rates at approximately current levels, represent massive changes in the world energy system, in land use, and in other sectors on a worldwide scale. Policies intended to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (e.g., scenario RCWR) will involve even greater alteration in worldwide human activity.\n**\n\nAt what level will the emissions of greenhouse gases be stabilized, and at what cost? EPA's Stabilizing Report does not address the issue of cost, but recent work of Manne and Richels (1991) suggests that the cost of worldwide energy policies to reduce CO2 could be in the range of trillions of dollars.\n\nThe decisions on what level of emissions reduction do not have to be taken now. But if the leading term in global warming is the increase in carbon dioxide from increased worldwide use of coal, it would appear than an urgent research need is to develop alternative energy technologies appropriate for large scale use in both OECD and non-OECD countries. These technologies may be urgently needed to substitute for building a 21st century world energy sector that is dependent on increasing production from the large deposits of low-cost coal in China, the Soviet Union, India, the United States, and elsewhere.\n\nEven with aggressive research efforts, it is unlikely that the large uncertainties on the extent and character of climate change can be resolved soon. The global warming issue is likely to remain for at least the next several decades a matter for decision in the face of uncertainty, for which concepts of decision analysis (Raiffa, 1968; Howard et al., 1972) are appropriate. Perhaps the overriding policy question is whether to take action now, based on the available scientific information, or defer action until additional information becomes available. One class of actions that can be taken now is to develop options that will allow emissions reductions to be accomplished in the future more effectively and at lower cost. Options for meeting energy needs with lower emissions of greenhouse gases can be accomplished through research and improved energy planning (National Research Council, 1990). Energy technologies that can reduce the need for using coal in the 21st century may be the most important class of such options.\n\nThe United States and the other OECD nations have technological capabilities and capital resources that could be shared with other nations in pursuit of the goals of sustainable economic development and stabilizing the atmosphere against global warming. While expanded research on climate change and its consequent impacts on the biosphere is clearly needed, research and development of appropriate energy technologies and better energy planning methods may be even more important, to provide the means that will be needed to achieve atmospheric stabilization at a level of cost that the nations of the world believe they can afford. The greatest opportunities may be in avoiding increased emissions from the non-OECD nations as these nations develop the energy sectors of their economies.\n\nReferences: **\n\nEPA (1989) US Environmental Protection Agency, *The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change in the United States,* Draft Report to Congress.\n\nEPA (1989a), US Environmental Protection Agency, *The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change in the United States,* Report to Congress,Washington, D.C., US Government Printing Office, EPA-230-05-89-050.\n[US Environmental Protection Agency website.](http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/resourcecenterpublicationsslrpotentialuseffects.html)\n\nEPA (1989), *Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate,* Draft Report to Congress.\n\nEnergy Modeling Forum (1990), \"EMF12 Study Prospectus,\" Stanford University.\n\nHoward, R., J.

Warner North****\n\nNorthWorks, Inc., Belmont CA, USA; and\nDepartment of Management Science and Engineering,\nStanford University,\nStanford, CA USA\n\nPaper prepared for the SEIF-IV Conference,\nBrussels, Belgium, November 14-16, 2005;\nRevised December 4, 2005. (Minor editorial changes were made when placing this paper on the web, April 2006.)\n\nAbstract**\n\n     Under the agreement by which Lithuania became a member of the European Union, Lithuania has agreed to shut down the two units of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which until last year have been providing approximately 80% of Lithuania's electricity, including a substantial surplus for export. Unit #1 was shut down at the end of 2004, and Unit #2 is scheduled to be shut down by the end of 2009. One year ago, at the suggestion of Christian Kirchsteiger of the Institute for Energy, DG-JRC, the author began a case study on Lithuania's energy future, first as a class assignment for a class in Public Policy Analysis at Stanford University, and then supplemented by visits to the Lithuanian Energy Institute. These investigations have led to a conclusion that dependence on natural gas from Russia will be a crucial aspect as Lithuania plans for the transition from its existing nuclear generation to alternatives, the most readily available and economical of which are natural gas and other low-cost fossil fuel, such as orimulsion from Venezuela. Lithuania is highly dependent on a single natural gas pipeline from Russia. The recently announced decision to construct a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea does nothing to alleviate this dependence, a problem identified in the EC 'Green Paper' of 2000. This paper reviews previous analysis on Lithuanian energy supply and proposes that additional analysis should be carried out to focus on risk of interruption in natural gas supply, using tools of probabilistic risk analysis and energy models, suitably adapted to the task. Such analysis should provide a more transparent basis for discussion and evaluation of alternatives to improve the reliability of natural gas supply, a subject of deep concern for Lithuania and other Baltic countries, and also an important subject for other EU countries and for the Russian Federation, which is becoming the dominant supplier of natural gas to much of Europe.\n**\n\nI. History and Background****\n\n     The expansion of the European Union to include nations once a part of the Soviet Union provides challenges to the European political leadership, in particular, the challenge of energy planning to secure a reliable supply of energy at a reasonable cost. The energy infrastructure for the Soviet Union was built on a regional basis, with an extensive system of high-voltage transmission lines and pipelines for oil and gas transport. A main source of electric power for the western Soviet Union was the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), with two 1500 MW nuclear generating units of the graphite channel (RBMK-2) type, the same Soviet design as at the Chernobyl NPP in the Ukraine. Ignalina NPP became a part of Lithuania when Lithuania became an independent country. Its 3000 MW generation capacity allowed Lithuania to meet most of its own needs for electricity from this NPP and also to export large amounts of electricity to Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation.\n\n     A condition agreed to by Lithuania for becoming a full member of the European Union (EU) is that the two Ignalina units will be shut down. Unit #1 ceased to operate at the end of 2004 and is not expected to operate again. Unit #2 is planned to cease operation by the end of 2009. This unit is now rated at 1350 MW. The motivation for the closure of these nuclear units is concern over their safety, and the EU has promised financial assistance to Lithuania in making the needed transition to other energy sources. The details of this assistance are not yet worked out.\n\n     The author's primary background and expertise is risk and decision analysis. In the 1970s the author was involved in a number of energy planning studies in the United States, including the analysis of a major Presidential initiative to create a one million barrels per day synthetic fuel capability within ten years [1,2] and a comparison of the economic and social costs of coal and nuclear generation [3]. The author also chaired the review of the first set of reports to Congress on global climate change, for the Science Advisory Board of the US Environmental Protection Agency [4]. Last October, the author substituted on short notice for his Stanford University colleague Stephen Schneider in giving a presentation on global climate alteration in Stuttgart, at a meeting organized by the Minister of Transport and Energy of the State of Baden-W'rttemberg [5]. Especially in the roundtable discussion that followed the presentations, which included leaders of German industry and representatives from the German Bundestag, the author became persuaded that formal analysis of the kind done in the United States in the 1970s would be very helpful in Europe. The role of nuclear power seemed a particularly divisive issue, as some countries (e.g., France, Finland) are heavily dependent on nuclear generation, while others (e.g., Austria, Germany, Sweden) either have discontinued use of nuclear power plants or have passed legislation that nuclear plants in these countries should be shut down. After the conference in Stuttgart the author visited Dr. Christian Kirchsteiger at the JRC in Petten, for discussion on [3] and related topics of current interest for the Institute for Energy. The result was the identification of Lithuania as a case study that might illustrate important problems for EC energy planners and associated needs for new or improved analytical tools to address these problems. The nuclear decision for Lithuania is, at least in principle, already made: Ignalina NPP is to be shut down, within five years. The issues to be addressed are how Lithuania will meet its need for energy, and in particular, electricity, in the period following the NPP shut down, and how EC should assist Lithuania, as it has agreed to do.\n\n     During the past year the author has carried out an initial exploration of these issues, first as a class exercise for a class taught winter quarter at Stanford University (MS&E 290, Public Policy Analysis), and then by making several visits to meet with leading experts at the Lithuanian Energy Institute (LEI), who have been most generous in introducing him to their country and their research activities. The main published sources are the National Strategic Plan [6], the 'Energy supply options' IAEA report of 2004 [7], and the LEI Annual report of 2003 [8]. Other presentations at this SEIF-IV conference by Drs. J. Augutis [9] and A. Galinis and D. Tarvydas [10] provide additional information on LEI research and its perspective on Lithuania's energy future.\n\n     A forecast from [6] (and [8]) of electric generation from 2002 to 2025 is shown in Figure 1. In 2002, the Ignalia NPP produced approximately 80% of Lithuania's electricity generation, with much of the remainder coming from central heating plants (CHP) in Vilnius and Kaunas, Lithuania's two largest cities. These plants produce both electricity and steam for regional heating use during the winter season. Beginning in 2010 when Ignalina Unit #2 is no longer available, about 8,000 GWh (gigawatt-hours) of electricity must be produced from other sources: the 1800 MW Lithuanian Thermal Power Plant (TPP), the various CHPs in Lithuania, and one or more new gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) plants, which offer much higher thermal efficiency in producing electricity from oil or natural gas fuels. Since 1995 the Lithuanians have been experimenting with orimulsion, a mixture of water, bitumen (tar) with up to 3% sulfur and heavy metals, and surfactant. The source is Venezuela, and orimulsion has the advantage that it easily handled compared to coal: It can be transported and stored as a liquid. While it is inexpensive compared to natural gas, it requires sulfur removal via flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and particulate removal. Considerable progress has been made in adding such capability to the large Lithuanian Thermal Power Plant. 450 MW (two of eight units) are already set up so these boilers can burn orimulsion [7,11] Adding such air pollution control equipment to the CHPs may be more difficult, and orimulsion is unlikely to be feasible for gas turbines, for which clean distillate or natural gas fuel is needed to avoid erosion of turbine blades. While some heavy oil may be available from Lithuania's refinery at Mazeikiai, it is not expected to play a large role. Similarly, the role of renewables is expected to be small in meeting the need to replace the generation when Ignalina Unit #2 shuts down. Coal is not currently used in power generation in Lithuania, although a small amount is used in households and for small boilers. Because of the need for construction of coal handling facilities and the air pollution control requirements, use of imported coal for power generation is not currently being considered in Lithuania.\n\n     The primary contenders to replace the electricity generation from Ignalina, according to [6,7], are one or more new GTCC plants, the various CHPs, and the Lithuanian TPP. The CHPs and Lithuanian TPP may need further modernization to improve efficiency and to enable the expanded use of orimulsion. If natural gas is inexpensive and reliable, greatly expanded use of this cheaper but dirty fuel may be the best option. If natural gas is more expensive and its supply judged less reliable, Lithuania may wish to use a large quality of imported orimulsion, (as indicated in [7], scenarios 1,2, pages 122-123.) Building a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina was also considered in [7], but will not be considered in this paper.\n\n     Unless one considers building a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina, the planning problem comes down to a greatly increased reliance on natural gas from Russia, or a smaller increase in natural gas from Russia plus importation of orimulsion from Venezuela, and the modernization of power plants and perhaps adding new ones with higher efficiency in converting fossil fuel into electricity. Two points from the National Energy Strategy should be emphasized because of the events that have occurred since this document was prepared in 2002. First, the large increase for world crude oil (currently at about $60 per barrel for Brent Crude), and natural gas prices set in world markets through competition with oil, imply that Lithuania faces a major economic burden in converting from the cheap nuclear electricity from Ignalina to electricity from alternative sources. Lithuania is a small country, and it will require considerable financial help. 'The early closure of the Ignalina NPP without the required financing from the European Union and international financial institutions would become an unbearable burden on the economy of the country.' ([6], page 10.)\n\n     Second, even with and more so without the use of orimulsion, Lithuania is dependent on its natural gas from one supplier country, Russia, and through one pipeline. 'A transit gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe, if constructed across the territory of the country [Lithuania] would highly increase the strategic reliability of supply.' ([6], page 9.) Much to the disappointment of Lithuania and its neighbors such as Latvia, Estonia, and Poland, the decision taken in September, 2005 by Russia and Germany, to proceed with construction of a natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, essentially precludes construction of a natural gas pipeline on the overland 'Amber' route through Latvia and Lithuania. The 'Amber' route or construction of a second pipeline on the route of the existing Yamal route through Belarus to Poland would have provided a redundant pathway for Russian natural gas into Eastern Europe.\n\nII. Natural Gas Supply: Economics and Politics. ****\n\n     The European Commission Green Paper on energy security of 2000 [12] highlights the problems illustrated by the quote above from page 9 of the Lithuanian National Energy Strategy [6]: 'Indeed, a number of Member States, and in particular the applicant countries, are entirely dependent on a single gas pipeline that links them to a single supplier country.' ([12], page. 25.) 'The challenges posed by the transit problem have also been significantly complicated by the emergence of the New Independent States (NIS) out of the ruins of the Soviet Union.' ([12], page 26.) 'It is essential for the [European] Union to maintain satisfactory relations with the transit countries if it is to have stable access to the energy products it needs. This is especially true for gas, where the main risk lies in transit conditions and continuing diversification of transport routes, not in the status of world reserves.' ([12], page 26).\n\n     It is not clear that much progress has been made in developing policies or analytical tools in support of policy making to deal with the insecurity of natural gas supply from Russian through a single pipeline to Lithuania, and similar dependence for other countries in Eastern Europe. A search through documents on the European Commission website provides indications that others who have looked at the security of gas supply more recently have reached similar conclusions. \"' it is obvious that political destabilization in Russia, or economic uncertainty, could trigger a supply shortfall in future supplies.' ([13], page 60). Keith C. Smith, the former American Ambassador to Lithuania, has recently written a report [14] on Russian energy politics and its influence in Eastern Europe. His paper [15] for the SIEF-IV Conference should provide important perspective on these determinants of the security of gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In April of 2004 the supply of natural gas to Belarus was curtailed after the Belarus government failed to pay its bill for the Russian gas. Since Lithuania obtains its gas from the pipeline through Belarus, it found that its gas supply was cut off. An emergency arrangement, transporting gas though an existing but unused pipeline through Latvia, was carried out despite the absence of metering equipment on the border between Lithuania and Latvia. In this way the impacts of a shortfall in Lithuania were reduced. Lithuania and Poland both asked Russia for compensation to their economies. Gazprom, supported by the Russian government, denied these requests. ([14]). This incident points out that Russia can shut off a gas pipeline, and Lithuanians are understandably concerned that this could happen again.\n\n     The positive side is that natural gas from Russia is an excellent alternative to meet Lithuania's needs, especially in the post-Ignalina shutdown period. The reasoning is set forth in the National Energy Strategy, [6], page 32:\nTechnically and ecologically, natural gas is the most effective fossil fuel with its vast world reserves. Taking into consideration the large resources of Russia's gas fields, the routes of and trends in their export to the West, the existing technical supply facilities and the ever more stringent environmental requirements, natural gas in Lithuania is the most promising kind of fossil fuel during the whole period under review.\n\n     This same viewpoint holds true for Europe as a whole. Increased use of gas from the large supplies in Russia can provide ample amounts of clean fossil fuel to replace the depleting gas supplies from the North Sea, and provide Europe with an energy supply that can help bridge a transition to new and improved forms of energy from renewables or from nuclear power, possibly including fusion, in the latter portion of the 21st century. Natural gas contributes much less carbon dioxide per unit of energy than coal or oil.\n\n     This author's working hypothesis is that the risk of potential interruption in natural gas supply to Lithuania is one of the most important areas for Lithuania's energy planning for the period after the planned shutdown of Ignalina Unit #2 in 2010. As long as Ignalina is still operating, then Lithuania's dependence on natural gas imported from Russia is much reduced. But after the nuclear generation ceases, then Lithuania's electricity supply, as well as other aspects of its energy infrastructure, will depend of natural gas, with perhaps some modest reduction from use of orimulsion and heavy fuel oil. There as yet is no intertie with Poland and the Western European electricity grid, and undersea connection to the Nordic countries (via a 'Baltic Ring') is also still in the planning stage. Both interconnections will be expensive, and it is not clear that these interconnections will be of sufficient capacity to be able to provide enough electricity to make up for a large shortfall in generation in Lithuania.\n\n     Natural gas is not as easily stored as oil, and Lithuania does not yet have an underground storage facility for natural gas. Western Latvia has favorable geology for even larger underground storage. A proposed storage project in Latvia is shown in Figure 2, and underground gas storage projects for Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland are shown among the DG-TREN Trans-European energy projects [16], page 34-35. This document states, 'Gas stocks need to be assured for at least 60 days of normal use.' That will be a difficult requirement to meet in the period after the Ignalina Unit #2 shutdown. Another possible addition is another natural gas pipeline. Adding metering equipment to the pipeline in Latvia would seem like excellent insurance in case there is another interruption in supply through the pipeline through Belarus. An improved pipeline to Kaliningrad is advocated in the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 33). If a spur pipeline were run from the Baltic undersea pipeline to Poland (see dotted line in Figure 2) or Kaliningrad and then into Lithuania, and this line were built at sufficient size, then gas from the new Baltic pipeline from Russia could be moved eastward into Lithuania to assure adequate supply, in case of an interruption of supply through the pipelines to the east of Lithuania. A large two-way pipeline link through Kaliningrad might improve the security of gas supply to Latvia and to other neighboring countries as well.\n\n     What are the main threats to the adequacy of natural gas supply to meet demand? Four categories of such threats might be examined. First, unusual weather such as a prolonged period of extreme cold can lead to increased demand, exceeding available supply, or weather-related equipment failures. Most electric and gas utilities plan for extreme weather, but occasionally shortfalls occur. There have been many examples in the United States, most recently, the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. Second, equipment failures can occur in the absence of severe weather. Such failures become more likely if equipment is not appropriately upgraded and maintained. Compressor stations can fail and gas pipelines can corrode. Third, acts of terrorism or sabotage can lead to loss of facilities. Such actions have become a worldwide concern, and recent events in Russia have demonstrated the ability of terrorists to carry out well planned and sophisticated attacks on schools, airplanes, and police stations. So far there have not been efforts to attack energy infrastructure in Russia. Fourth, supply can be deliberatively interrupted for economic or political reasons -- as happened to Belarus, and Lithuania, in April of 2004.\n\n     Investment in increased gas storage and in additional pipelines can lead to a more robust and secure supply system for natural gas from Russia to meet the needs in Lithuania and other nations of the EU. It is an urgent need for Lithuania, and Lithuania has been promised financial assistance. What configuration of storage and gas transmission lines represents the best investment in achieving adequate security of supply? These projects to construct new pipelines and storage facilities are very expensive, at the level of tens of millions of euros for storage projects to the order of 6 billion euros for the Baltic Undersea natural gas pipeline [16]. What institutional arrangements between EU countries including Lithuania and its New Independent State neighbors (using the language cited above from the Green Paper) are needed to assure that Russia will not unreasonably interrupt supply or charge unreasonably high prices for its gas? These seem like very important issues for the EC to address, and in our review we have not come up with much evidence that the EC energy research centers are addressing these issues with modern analytical tools. We now turn our attention to describing such tools.\n\nIII. Analytical Tools Area #1 ' Probabilistic Risk Analysis. ****\n\n     A shortfall or failure in a complex system often can be described as a scenario, a set of events leading to this failure. Probabilistic models of such event sequences have a long history in statistics and reliability theory. Such approaches were developed in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and then widely applied in these industries and elsewhere. Decision analysis evolved out of statistical decision theory in the aftermath of World War II. In decision analysis, sequences are examined of decisions and uncertain events. A decision tree is often used as a visual display and as a computing device for computing the probability distributions corresponding to different decision alternatives, and then evaluating these to find the best decision [17].\n\n     Influence diagrams evolved from decision trees to deal with situations in which a sequence of events occurs, with a complex structure of conditionality. For example, a series of ten to twenty uncertain events precedes the system failure of interest, and the probabilities assigned to one of these events may depend on some (say, 2 to 6), but not all of the preceding events in the sequence. With binary events, a sequence of ten events leads to a thousand end points or scenarios, and 20 leads to a million. An illustration of such an event tree showing all the possible outcomes becomes impractical. The influence diagram is a schematic form that shows by means of arrows connecting nodes the conditionality structure. The basic idea was developed by Allen C. Miller and colleagues in a military application and first published in unclassified form in [18]. It has achieved widespread use in decision analysis, operations research [19] reliability [20] and also in computer science applications, sometimes under the term, Bayesian nets. A recent application to terrorism by the author's department chairman at Stanford and one of her students is found in [21]. Software packages for influence diagram computations are available from several sources. For the illustrative example below, the author has used Decision Advisor, a propriety software package for R&D management marketed by SmartOrg of Menlo Park, CA.\n\n     We described above that failure of the natural gas supply system to meet gas demand might result from four types of events:\n\n- peak demands and/or reduced supply resulting from extreme weather\n\n- equipment failure for reasons other than extreme weather\n\n- terrorist attacks\n\n- deliberate interruption in supply by the leadership in the supplying country.\n\nLet's place this in the form of an influence diagram, which is shown in Figure 3.\n\n     The arrows show conditionality for dependence of the uncertain events on preceding events. For example, we assume that a failure of the system to meet peak demands as the result of extreme weather depends on whether the extreme weather occurs (and perhaps to what extent) and on the configuration of the pipeline and storage system. An analysis might consider a base case and several alternatives in which additional investment has been made to have storage facilities and one or more additional pipelines from the supplier country. For each system configuration and each of the weather outcomes, a probability is assigned to each of the cases for a supply shortfall. We show below in Figure 4 a decision tree representation: two outcomes for extreme weather (yes and no), three systems configurations (base and two alternatives) and two possibilities for shortfall (shortage and none).\n\n     Obviously, this example is extremely simplified. The approach is capable of using a much more complex structure of conditional events represented as nodes in the influence diagram. For the other three terms, we have conditioned equipment failure only on the configuration decision, and we condition 'terrorist attack' on 'supplier political evolution.' 'Deliberate flow restriction' is also conditioned on what happens in 'supplier political evolution.' This node is intended to describe what might happen politically in Russia during the next 5-15 years, and perhaps in neighboring countries like Belarus as well. A very simple characterization of three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive outcomes might be: continued steady progress in democracy, protracted civil unrest, and reversion to authoritarian imperialism. Probabilities are assigned to each of these outcomes, based on the judgment of experts in the politics of the area. Disagreement among such experts can be expected. Which judgments are most important? Sensitivity analysis can help determine which judgments are most important.\n\n     Moving from left to right and then down the influence diagram, probabilities are assigned to 'terrorist attack,' conditional on which of these outcomes occurs and the system configuration alterative. 'Deliberate flow restriction' is shown conditioned only on 'supplier political evolution.'\n\n     Once the set of conditional probability assignments are complete and outcomes for 'unmet demand' resulting from the four sets of causes are described, then the software can compute probability distributions for each configuration, so that costs and risks of supply interruptions of different time periods and regional impact magnitudes can be compared. An illustrative cumulative distribution is shown below in Figure 5. It shows a moderate probability (about 7%) of a limited shortfall judged to be worth about\n' 1 billion, and a much smaller probability (0.7 %) of a much larger shortfall, valued at\n' 60 billion. Such a disaster would be comparable to the impacts the US is currently experiencing from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. It might plausibly result from a major, extended interruption in Russian gas, perhaps from a series of successful terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or an extreme action, or series of actions by the Russian leadership to reduce supply to European countries.\n\n     Reference [21] describes an application of influence diagrams at a much more sophisticated level of complexity. The structure shown here is intended only as a highly simplistic description of the methodology, for those not familiar with influence diagrams and probabilistic risk analysis. Applications of probabilistic risk analysis to weather and equipment failure are widely carried out by gas and electric utilities. Application to the threat posed by terrorism and political decisions to interrupt supply are not widely practiced. It may be useful to carry out such an analysis as the basis for dialogue among the concerned parties. For example, some parties in Russia may assert that the threat of terrorist attack in Lithuania and other Baltic countries led to a preference for the Baltic Undersea pipeline route over a cheaper overland route.\n\nIV. Analytical Tools Area #2: Energy Models for Long-range Planning ****\n\n     Planning the future of a complex energy system on a time scale of many decades is a daunting challenge. Dating back at least to period in the 1970s when the United States was considering large investments in new energy systems, such computer planning models are increasingly being used by businesses and government agencies. The analysis in [7] involves the use of linear programming, which has been widely applied in the US and internationally.\n\n     Stanford University has since the 1970s had an activity called the Energy Modeling Forum, in which leaders in the field of energy modeling bring their models (often proprietary computer software, developed at considerable investment expense) and come together to analyze case exercises, from regional planning to global response in the context of global climate change. Reference [22] is a report on dealing with natural gas supply in North America. One of the models used in the exercise described in [22], the North American Gas Model (NARG), is a direct descendent of the SRI-Gulf model used for the synthetic fuel commercialization analysis described in [1] and [2]. In [22] this model is being used on behalf of the California Energy Commission; it has also been used for many leading US and international oil and gas companies. The lead modeler, Dale Nesbitt, worked with the author on the 1975 synthetic fuel analysis ([1] and [2]). The generalized equilibrium methodology involves an extension from mathematical programming to finding the fixed point solution x to an equation f(x) = x, where x is a vector of very high dimensionality describing flow quantities and prices of energy materials at different locations in a network connecting energy resources in the ground to energy end use demands, and at different time points from the beginning to the end of the planning horizon [23,24]. The NARG model and its European counterpart, the European Gas Model, are not unique to one vendor. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Rice University have developed similar models based on the generalized equilibrium approach.\n\n     The author takes the position that an understanding of the European energy system, over a period from five to fifteen, perhaps as much as fifty years into the future, will require the use of advanced energy modeling tools. Energy models are particularly useful for projecting changes as energy prices and the availability of energy technologies change over time. The models can also be used to analyze upset conditions, such as those currently prevailing in the US, with numerous refineries and many gas production and processing facilities temporarily out of service because of hurricane damage.\n\nV. Conclusions and Recommendations ****\n\n     The 1975 analysis [1,2] of the US decision on investing billions of dollars to create a million-barrel-per-day industry to make gas and liquid fuels from coal and oil shale showed this investment was a poor idea. It was voted down by Congress under the Ford Administration, but then established under the succeeding Carter Administration. It failed badly, for reasons that were foreseen in the analysis: The increased prices of oil and other energy materials that occurred in the mid-1970s led to reduction in demand and expansion of conventional oil and gas supplies, with the result that there was no market for high-cost synthetic fuel made from shale and coal.\n\n     The analytic tools used for the analysis ([1] and [2]) included a decision tree describing important uncertainties and how future decisions to expand capacity would depend on the immediate decisions to be taken in the mid-1970s. About three thousand scenarios were represented in the decision tree, and across this large number of scenarios (with some approximations via curve fitting) an energy model was used to assess how prices, technology choices, and energy quantities might evolve for that scenario.\n\n     Such tools should be very valuable in helping to understand Lithuania's energy future and the decisions facing Lithuania, the EU, and other organizations that must help Lithuania to finance its transition away from using the inexpensive nuclear electricity from Ignalina. It is the author's impression that the Lithuanian Energy Institute is relatively sophisticated in the use of energy modeling and probabilistic risk assessment. The author is not aware of analysis on behalf of the EU or the EC where such tools are being used, for example, to assist on decisions for determining which alternative pipeline routes should be selected. It is the author's impression that selection of the Baltic Undersea route over the Amber and Yamal-II routes was a bilateral decision by Russia and Germany. Many other countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland have expressed considerable unhappiness over this decision and the way it was made. There was no analysis made transparent through extensive publicly available documentation to inform discussion, debate, and analysis of the alternative pipeline routes. As one who has invested much time in considering how decision analysis can assist difficult decisions on public policy [25,26], this author must recommend that the staff of the EC needs to improve the extent to which it can assist senior policy makers such as the leader of DG-TREN in making decisions affecting the security of Europe's energy supply ' particularly natural gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In the Preface to the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 5), the LEI Director at that time, Professor Jurgis Vilemas, stated, 'Decision-making will hopefully, in the end, be based on economic reasoning, realistic demand forecasts and the latest achievements in development of energy generation technology.' This is an excellent place to start. I believe that Professor Vilemas and his LEI colleagues have also concluded that the reasoning should be broadened from a focus on purely economic reasoning to include the four types of risk issues that have been listed in this paper and illustrated in the simple influence diagram: extreme weather, equipment failure, terrorism and sabotage, and political interference in energy trade. I hope the SEIF-IV participants and the management of DG-TREN will endorse this expanded view on what needs to be done to support good decision making, both in Lithuania and for the EU, of which Lithuania is now a member.\n\nReferences****\n\n[1].

          "' it is obvious that political destabilization in Russia, or economic uncertainty, could trigger a supply shortfall in future supplies.' ([13], page 60). Keith C. Smith, the former American Ambassador to Lithuania, has recently written a report [14] on Russian energy politics and its influence in Eastern Europe. His paper [15] for the SIEF-IV Conference should provide important perspective on these determinants of the security of gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In April of 2004 the supply of natural gas to Belarus was curtailed after the Belarus government failed to pay its bill for the Russian gas.

Natural gas contributes much less carbon dioxide per unit of energy than coal or oil.\n\n     This author's working hypothesis is that the risk of potential interruption in natural gas supply to Lithuania is one of the most important areas for Lithuania's energy planning for the period after the planned shutdown of Ignalina Unit #2 in 2010. As long as Ignalina is still operating, then Lithuania's dependence on natural gas imported from Russia is much reduced. But after the nuclear generation ceases, then Lithuania's electricity supply, as well as other aspects of its energy infrastructure, will depend of natural gas, with perhaps some modest reduction from use of orimulsion and heavy fuel oil. There as yet is no intertie with Poland and the Western European electricity grid, and undersea connection to the Nordic countries (via a 'Baltic Ring') is also still in the planning stage. Both interconnections will be expensive, and it is not clear that these interconnections will be of sufficient capacity to be able to provide enough electricity to make up for a large shortfall in generation in Lithuania.\n\n     Natural gas is not as easily stored as oil, and Lithuania does not yet have an underground storage facility for natural gas. Western Latvia has favorable geology for even larger underground storage. A proposed storage project in Latvia is shown in Figure 2, and underground gas storage projects for Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland are shown among the DG-TREN Trans-European energy projects [16], page 34-35. This document states, 'Gas stocks need to be assured for at least 60 days of normal use.' That will be a difficult requirement to meet in the period after the Ignalina Unit #2 shutdown. Another possible addition is another natural gas pipeline. Adding metering equipment to the pipeline in Latvia would seem like excellent insurance in case there is another interruption in supply through the pipeline through Belarus. An improved pipeline to Kaliningrad is advocated in the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 33). If a spur pipeline were run from the Baltic undersea pipeline to Poland (see dotted line in Figure 2) or Kaliningrad and then into Lithuania, and this line were built at sufficient size, then gas from the new Baltic pipeline from Russia could be moved eastward into Lithuania to assure adequate supply, in case of an interruption of supply through the pipelines to the east of Lithuania. A large two-way pipeline link through Kaliningrad might improve the security of gas supply to Latvia and to other neighboring countries as well.\n\n     What are the main threats to the adequacy of natural gas supply to meet demand? Four categories of such threats might be examined. First, unusual weather such as a prolonged period of extreme cold can lead to increased demand, exceeding available supply, or weather-related equipment failures. Most electric and gas utilities plan for extreme weather, but occasionally shortfalls occur. There have been many examples in the United States, most recently, the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. Second, equipment failures can occur in the absence of severe weather. Such failures become more likely if equipment is not appropriately upgraded and maintained. Compressor stations can fail and gas pipelines can corrode. Third, acts of terrorism or sabotage can lead to loss of facilities. Such actions have become a worldwide concern, and recent events in Russia have demonstrated the ability of terrorists to carry out well planned and sophisticated attacks on schools, airplanes, and police stations. So far there have not been efforts to attack energy infrastructure in Russia. Fourth, supply can be deliberatively interrupted for economic or political reasons -- as happened to Belarus, and Lithuania, in April of 2004.\n\n     Investment in increased gas storage and in additional pipelines can lead to a more robust and secure supply system for natural gas from Russia to meet the needs in Lithuania and other nations of the EU. It is an urgent need for Lithuania, and Lithuania has been promised financial assistance. What configuration of storage and gas transmission lines represents the best investment in achieving adequate security of supply? These projects to construct new pipelines and storage facilities are very expensive, at the level of tens of millions of euros for storage projects to the order of 6 billion euros for the Baltic Undersea natural gas pipeline [16]. What institutional arrangements between EU countries including Lithuania and its New Independent State neighbors (using the language cited above from the Green Paper) are needed to assure that Russia will not unreasonably interrupt supply or charge unreasonably high prices for its gas? These seem like very important issues for the EC to address, and in our review we have not come up with much evidence that the EC energy research centers are addressing these issues with modern analytical tools. We now turn our attention to describing such tools.\n\nIII. Analytical Tools Area #1 ' Probabilistic Risk Analysis. \n\n     A shortfall or failure in a complex system often can be described as a scenario, a set of events leading to this failure. Probabilistic models of such event sequences have a long history in statistics and reliability theory. Such approaches were developed in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and then widely applied in these industries and elsewhere. Decision analysis evolved out of statistical decision theory in the aftermath of World War II. In decision analysis, sequences are examined of decisions and uncertain events. A decision tree is often used as a visual display and as a computing device for computing the probability distributions corresponding to different decision alternatives, and then evaluating these to find the best decision [17].\n\n     Influence diagrams evolved from decision trees to deal with situations in which a sequence of events occurs, with a complex structure of conditionality. For example, a series of ten to twenty uncertain events precedes the system failure of interest, and the probabilities assigned to one of these events may depend on some (say, 2 to 6), but not all of the preceding events in the sequence. With binary events, a sequence of ten events leads to a thousand end points or scenarios, and 20 leads to a million. An illustration of such an event tree showing all the possible outcomes becomes impractical. The influence diagram is a schematic form that shows by means of arrows connecting nodes the conditionality structure. The basic idea was developed by Allen C. Miller and colleagues in a military application and first published in unclassified form in [18]. It has achieved widespread use in decision analysis, operations research [19] reliability [20] and also in computer science applications, sometimes under the term, Bayesian nets. A recent application to terrorism by the author's department chairman at Stanford and one of her students is found in [21]. Software packages for influence diagram computations are available from several sources. For the illustrative example below, the author has used Decision Advisor, a propriety software package for R&D management marketed by SmartOrg of Menlo Park, CA.\n\n     We described above that failure of the natural gas supply system to meet gas demand might result from four types of events:\n\n- peak demands and/or reduced supply resulting from extreme weather\n\n- equipment failure for reasons other than extreme weather\n\n- terrorist attacks\n\n- deliberate interruption in supply by the leadership in the supplying country.\n\nLet's place this in the form of an influence diagram, which is shown in Figure 3.\n\n     The arrows show conditionality for dependence of the uncertain events on preceding events. For example, we assume that a failure of the system to meet peak demands as the result of extreme weather depends on whether the extreme weather occurs (and perhaps to what extent) and on the configuration of the pipeline and storage system. An analysis might consider a base case and several alternatives in which additional investment has been made to have storage facilities and one or more additional pipelines from the supplier country. For each system configuration and each of the weather outcomes, a probability is assigned to each of the cases for a supply shortfall. We show below in Figure 4 a decision tree representation: two outcomes for extreme weather (yes and no), three systems configurations (base and two alternatives) and two possibilities for shortfall (shortage and none).\n\n     Obviously, this example is extremely simplified. The approach is capable of using a much more complex structure of conditional events represented as nodes in the influence diagram. For the other three terms, we have conditioned equipment failure only on the configuration decision, and we condition 'terrorist attack' on 'supplier political evolution.' 'Deliberate flow restriction' is also conditioned on what happens in 'supplier political evolution.' This node is intended to describe what might happen politically in Russia during the next 5-15 years, and perhaps in neighboring countries like Belarus as well. A very simple characterization of three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive outcomes might be: continued steady progress in democracy, protracted civil unrest, and reversion to authoritarian imperialism. Probabilities are assigned to each of these outcomes, based on the judgment of experts in the politics of the area. Disagreement among such experts can be expected. Which judgments are most important? Sensitivity analysis can help determine which judgments are most important.\n\n     Moving from left to right and then down the influence diagram, probabilities are assigned to 'terrorist attack,' conditional on which of these outcomes occurs and the system configuration alterative. 'Deliberate flow restriction' is shown conditioned only on 'supplier political evolution.'\n\n     Once the set of conditional probability assignments are complete and outcomes for 'unmet demand' resulting from the four sets of causes are described, then the software can compute probability distributions for each configuration, so that costs and risks of supply interruptions of different time periods and regional impact magnitudes can be compared. An illustrative cumulative distribution is shown below in Figure 5. It shows a moderate probability (about 7%) of a limited shortfall judged to be worth about\n' 1 billion, and a much smaller probability (0.7 %) of a much larger shortfall, valued at\n' 60 billion. Such a disaster would be comparable to the impacts the US is currently experiencing from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. It might plausibly result from a major, extended interruption in Russian gas, perhaps from a series of successful terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or an extreme action, or series of actions by the Russian leadership to reduce supply to European countries.\n\n     Reference [21] describes an application of influence diagrams at a much more sophisticated level of complexity. The structure shown here is intended only as a highly simplistic description of the methodology, for those not familiar with influence diagrams and probabilistic risk analysis. Applications of probabilistic risk analysis to weather and equipment failure are widely carried out by gas and electric utilities. Application to the threat posed by terrorism and political decisions to interrupt supply are not widely practiced. It may be useful to carry out such an analysis as the basis for dialogue among the concerned parties. For example, some parties in Russia may assert that the threat of terrorist attack in Lithuania and other Baltic countries led to a preference for the Baltic Undersea pipeline route over a cheaper overland route.\n\nIV. Analytical Tools Area #2: Energy Models for Long-range Planning \n\n     Planning the future of a complex energy system on a time scale of many decades is a daunting challenge. Dating back at least to period in the 1970s when the United States was considering large investments in new energy systems, such computer planning models are increasingly being used by businesses and government agencies. The analysis in [7] involves the use of linear programming, which has been widely applied in the US and internationally.\n\n     Stanford University has since the 1970s had an activity called the Energy Modeling Forum, in which leaders in the field of energy modeling bring their models (often proprietary computer software, developed at considerable investment expense) and come together to analyze case exercises, from regional planning to global response in the context of global climate change. Reference [22] is a report on dealing with natural gas supply in North America. One of the models used in the exercise described in [22], the North American Gas Model (NARG), is a direct descendent of the SRI-Gulf model used for the synthetic fuel commercialization analysis described in [1] and [2]. In [22] this model is being used on behalf of the California Energy Commission; it has also been used for many leading US and international oil and gas companies. The lead modeler, Dale Nesbitt, worked with the author on the 1975 synthetic fuel analysis ([1] and [2]). The generalized equilibrium methodology involves an extension from mathematical programming to finding the fixed point solution x to an equation f(x) = x, where x is a vector of very high dimensionality describing flow quantities and prices of energy materials at different locations in a network connecting energy resources in the ground to energy end use demands, and at different time points from the beginning to the end of the planning horizon [23,24]. The NARG model and its European counterpart, the European Gas Model, are not unique to one vendor. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Rice University have developed similar models based on the generalized equilibrium approach.\n\n     The author takes the position that an understanding of the European energy system, over a period from five to fifteen, perhaps as much as fifty years into the future, will require the use of advanced energy modeling tools. Energy models are particularly useful for projecting changes as energy prices and the availability of energy technologies change over time. The models can also be used to analyze upset conditions, such as those currently prevailing in the US, with numerous refineries and many gas production and processing facilities temporarily out of service because of hurricane damage.\n\nV. Conclusions and Recommendations \n\n     The 1975 analysis [1,2] of the US decision on investing billions of dollars to create a million-barrel-per-day industry to make gas and liquid fuels from coal and oil shale showed this investment was a poor idea. It was voted down by Congress under the Ford Administration, but then established under the succeeding Carter Administration. It failed badly, for reasons that were foreseen in the analysis: The increased prices of oil and other energy materials that occurred in the mid-1970s led to reduction in demand and expansion of conventional oil and gas supplies, with the result that there was no market for high-cost synthetic fuel made from shale and coal.\n\n     The analytic tools used for the analysis ([1] and [2]) included a decision tree describing important uncertainties and how future decisions to expand capacity would depend on the immediate decisions to be taken in the mid-1970s. About three thousand scenarios were represented in the decision tree, and across this large number of scenarios (with some approximations via curve fitting) an energy model was used to assess how prices, technology choices, and energy quantities might evolve for that scenario.\n\n     Such tools should be very valuable in helping to understand Lithuania's energy future and the decisions facing Lithuania, the EU, and other organizations that must help Lithuania to finance its transition away from using the inexpensive nuclear electricity from Ignalina. It is the author's impression that the Lithuanian Energy Institute is relatively sophisticated in the use of energy modeling and probabilistic risk assessment. The author is not aware of analysis on behalf of the EU or the EC where such tools are being used, for example, to assist on decisions for determining which alternative pipeline routes should be selected. It is the author's impression that selection of the Baltic Undersea route over the Amber and Yamal-II routes was a bilateral decision by Russia and Germany. Many other countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland have expressed considerable unhappiness over this decision and the way it was made. There was no analysis made transparent through extensive publicly available documentation to inform discussion, debate, and analysis of the alternative pipeline routes. As one who has invested much time in considering how decision analysis can assist difficult decisions on public policy [25,26], this author must recommend that the staff of the EC needs to improve the extent to which it can assist senior policy makers such as the leader of DG-TREN in making decisions affecting the security of Europe's energy supply ' particularly natural gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In the Preface to the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 5), the LEI Director at that time, Professor Jurgis Vilemas, stated, 'Decision-making will hopefully, in the end, be based on economic reasoning, realistic demand forecasts and the latest achievements in development of energy generation technology.' This is an excellent place to start. I believe that Professor Vilemas and his LEI colleagues have also concluded that the reasoning should be broadened from a focus on purely economic reasoning to include the four types of risk issues that have been listed in this paper and illustrated in the simple influence diagram: extreme weather, equipment failure, terrorism and sabotage, and political interference in energy trade. I hope the SEIF-IV participants and the management of DG-TREN will endorse this expanded view on what needs to be done to support good decision making, both in Lithuania and for the EU, of which Lithuania is now a member.\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

          "\n\n     Under the agreement by which Lithuania became a member of the European Union, Lithuania has agreed to shut down the two units of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which until last year have been providing approximately 80% of Lithuania's electricity, including a substantial surplus for export. Unit #1 was shut down at the end of 2004, and Unit #2 is scheduled to be shut down by the end of 2009. One year ago, at the suggestion of Christian Kirchsteiger of the Institute for Energy, DG-JRC, the author began a case study on Lithuania's energy future, first as a class assignment for a class in Public Policy Analysis at Stanford University, and then supplemented by visits to the Lithuanian Energy Institute. These investigations have led to a conclusion that dependence on natural gas from Russia will be a crucial aspect as Lithuania plans for the transition from its existing nuclear generation to alternatives, the most readily available and economical of which are natural gas and other low-cost fossil fuel, such as orimulsion from Venezuela. Lithuania is highly dependent on a single natural gas pipeline from Russia. The recently announced decision to construct a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea does nothing to alleviate this dependence, a problem identified in the EC 'Green Paper' of 2000. This paper reviews previous analysis on Lithuanian energy supply and proposes that additional analysis should be carried out to focus on risk of interruption in natural gas supply, using tools of probabilistic risk analysis and energy models, suitably adapted to the task. Such analysis should provide a more transparent basis for discussion and evaluation of alternatives to improve the reliability of natural gas supply, a subject of deep concern for Lithuania and other Baltic countries, and also an important subject for other EU countries and for the Russian Federation, which is becoming the dominant supplier of natural gas to much of Europe.\n",
          "\n\nI. History and Background",
          "\n\n     The expansion of the European Union to include nations once a part of the Soviet Union provides challenges to the European political leadership, in particular, the challenge of energy planning to secure a reliable supply of energy at a reasonable cost. The energy infrastructure for the Soviet Union was built on a regional basis, with an extensive system of high-voltage transmission lines and pipelines for oil and gas transport. A main source of electric power for the western Soviet Union was the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), with two 1500 MW nuclear generating units of the graphite channel (RBMK-2) type, the same Soviet design as at the Chernobyl NPP in the Ukraine. Ignalina NPP became a part of Lithuania when Lithuania became an independent country. Its 3000 MW generation capacity allowed Lithuania to meet most of its own needs for electricity from this NPP and also to export large amounts of electricity to Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation.\n\n     A condition agreed to by Lithuania for becoming a full member of the European Union (EU) is that the two Ignalina units will be shut down. Unit #1 ceased to operate at the end of 2004 and is not expected to operate again. Unit #2 is planned to cease operation by the end of 2009. This unit is now rated at 1350 MW. The motivation for the closure of these nuclear units is concern over their safety, and the EU has promised financial assistance to Lithuania in making the needed transition to other energy sources. The details of this assistance are not yet worked out.\n\n     The author's primary background and expertise is risk and decision analysis. In the 1970s the author was involved in a number of energy planning studies in the United States, including the analysis of a major Presidential initiative to create a one million barrels per day synthetic fuel capability within ten years [1,2] and a comparison of the economic and social costs of coal and nuclear generation [3]. The author also chaired the review of the first set of reports to Congress on global climate change, for the Science Advisory Board of the US Environmental Protection Agency [4]. Last October, the author substituted on short notice for his Stanford University colleague Stephen Schneider in giving a presentation on global climate alteration in Stuttgart, at a meeting organized by the Minister of Transport and Energy of the State of Baden-W'rttemberg [5]. Especially in the roundtable discussion that followed the presentations, which included leaders of German industry and representatives from the German Bundestag, the author became persuaded that formal analysis of the kind done in the United States in the 1970s would be very helpful in Europe. The role of nuclear power seemed a particularly divisive issue, as some countries (e.g., France, Finland) are heavily dependent on nuclear generation, while others (e.g., Austria, Germany, Sweden) either have discontinued use of nuclear power plants or have passed legislation that nuclear plants in these countries should be shut down. After the conference in Stuttgart the author visited Dr. Christian Kirchsteiger at the JRC in Petten, for discussion on [3] and related topics of current interest for the Institute for Energy. The result was the identification of Lithuania as a case study that might illustrate important problems for EC energy planners and associated needs for new or improved analytical tools to address these problems. The nuclear decision for Lithuania is, at least in principle, already made: Ignalina NPP is to be shut down, within five years. The issues to be addressed are how Lithuania will meet its need for energy, and in particular, electricity, in the period following the NPP shut down, and how EC should assist Lithuania, as it has agreed to do.\n\n     During the past year the author has carried out an initial exploration of these issues, first as a class exercise for a class taught winter quarter at Stanford University (MS&E 290, Public Policy Analysis), and then by making several visits to meet with leading experts at the Lithuanian Energy Institute (LEI), who have been most generous in introducing him to their country and their research activities. The main published sources are the National Strategic Plan [6], the 'Energy supply options' IAEA report of 2004 [7], and the LEI Annual report of 2003 [8]. Other presentations at this SEIF-IV conference by Drs. J. Augutis [9] and A. Galinis and D. Tarvydas [10] provide additional information on LEI research and its perspective on Lithuania's energy future.\n\n     A forecast from [6] (and [8]) of electric generation from 2002 to 2025 is shown in Figure 1. In 2002, the Ignalia NPP produced approximately 80% of Lithuania's electricity generation, with much of the remainder coming from central heating plants (CHP) in Vilnius and Kaunas, Lithuania's two largest cities. These plants produce both electricity and steam for regional heating use during the winter season. Beginning in 2010 when Ignalina Unit #2 is no longer available, about 8,000 GWh (gigawatt-hours) of electricity must be produced from other sources: the 1800 MW Lithuanian Thermal Power Plant (TPP), the various CHPs in Lithuania, and one or more new gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) plants, which offer much higher thermal efficiency in producing electricity from oil or natural gas fuels. Since 1995 the Lithuanians have been experimenting with orimulsion, a mixture of water, bitumen (tar) with up to 3% sulfur and heavy metals, and surfactant. The source is Venezuela, and orimulsion has the advantage that it easily handled compared to coal: It can be transported and stored as a liquid. While it is inexpensive compared to natural gas, it requires sulfur removal via flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and particulate removal. Considerable progress has been made in adding such capability to the large Lithuanian Thermal Power Plant. 450 MW (two of eight units) are already set up so these boilers can burn orimulsion [7,11] Adding such air pollution control equipment to the CHPs may be more difficult, and orimulsion is unlikely to be feasible for gas turbines, for which clean distillate or natural gas fuel is needed to avoid erosion of turbine blades. While some heavy oil may be available from Lithuania's refinery at Mazeikiai, it is not expected to play a large role. Similarly, the role of renewables is expected to be small in meeting the need to replace the generation when Ignalina Unit #2 shuts down. Coal is not currently used in power generation in Lithuania, although a small amount is used in households and for small boilers. Because of the need for construction of coal handling facilities and the air pollution control requirements, use of imported coal for power generation is not currently being considered in Lithuania.\n\n     The primary contenders to replace the electricity generation from Ignalina, according to [6,7], are one or more new GTCC plants, the various CHPs, and the Lithuanian TPP. The CHPs and Lithuanian TPP may need further modernization to improve efficiency and to enable the expanded use of orimulsion. If natural gas is inexpensive and reliable, greatly expanded use of this cheaper but dirty fuel may be the best option. If natural gas is more expensive and its supply judged less reliable, Lithuania may wish to use a large quality of imported orimulsion, (as indicated in [7], scenarios 1,2, pages 122-123.) Building a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina was also considered in [7], but will not be considered in this paper.\n\n     Unless one considers building a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina, the planning problem comes down to a greatly increased reliance on natural gas from Russia, or a smaller increase in natural gas from Russia plus importation of orimulsion from Venezuela, and the modernization of power plants and perhaps adding new ones with higher efficiency in converting fossil fuel into electricity. Two points from the National Energy Strategy should be emphasized because of the events that have occurred since this document was prepared in 2002. First, the large increase for world crude oil (currently at about $60 per barrel for Brent Crude), and natural gas prices set in world markets through competition with oil, imply that Lithuania faces a major economic burden in converting from the cheap nuclear electricity from Ignalina to electricity from alternative sources. Lithuania is a small country, and it will require considerable financial help. 'The early closure of the Ignalina NPP without the required financing from the European Union and international financial institutions would become an unbearable burden on the economy of the country.' ([6], page 10.)\n\n     Second, even with and more so without the use of orimulsion, Lithuania is dependent on its natural gas from one supplier country, Russia, and through one pipeline. 'A transit gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe, if constructed across the territory of the country [Lithuania] would highly increase the strategic reliability of supply.' ([6], page 9.) Much to the disappointment of Lithuania and its neighbors such as Latvia, Estonia, and Poland, the decision taken in September, 2005 by Russia and Germany, to proceed with construction of a natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, essentially precludes construction of a natural gas pipeline on the overland 'Amber' route through Latvia and Lithuania. The 'Amber' route or construction of a second pipeline on the route of the existing Yamal route through Belarus to Poland would have provided a redundant pathway for Russian natural gas into Eastern Europe.\n\nII. Natural Gas Supply: Economics and Politics. ",
          "\n\n     The European Commission Green Paper on energy security of 2000 [12] highlights the problems illustrated by the quote above from page 9 of the Lithuanian National Energy Strategy [6]: 'Indeed, a number of Member States, and in particular the applicant countries, are entirely dependent on a single gas pipeline that links them to a single supplier country.' ([12], page. 25.) 'The challenges posed by the transit problem have also been significantly complicated by the emergence of the New Independent States (NIS) out of the ruins of the Soviet Union.' ([12], page 26.) 'It is essential for the [European] Union to maintain satisfactory relations with the transit countries if it is to have stable access to the energy products it needs. This is especially true for gas, where the main risk lies in transit conditions and continuing diversification of transport routes, not in the status of world reserves.' ([12], page 26).\n\n     It is not clear that much progress has been made in developing policies or analytical tools in support of policy making to deal with the insecurity of natural gas supply from Russian through a single pipeline to Lithuania, and similar dependence for other countries in Eastern Europe. A search through documents on the European Commission website provides indications that others who have looked at the security of gas supply more recently have reached similar conclusions. ' it is obvious that political destabilization in Russia, or economic uncertainty, could trigger a supply shortfall in future supplies.' ([13], page 60). Keith C. Smith, the former American Ambassador to Lithuania, has recently written a report [14] on Russian energy politics and its influence in Eastern Europe. His paper [15] for the SIEF-IV Conference should provide important perspective on these determinants of the security of gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In April of 2004 the supply of natural gas to Belarus was curtailed after the Belarus government failed to pay its bill for the Russian gas. Since Lithuania obtains its gas from the pipeline through Belarus, it found that its gas supply was cut off. An emergency arrangement, transporting gas though an existing but unused pipeline through Latvia, was carried out despite the absence of metering equipment on the border between Lithuania and Latvia. In this way the impacts of a shortfall in Lithuania were reduced. Lithuania and Poland both asked Russia for compensation to their economies. Gazprom, supported by the Russian government, denied these requests. ([14]). This incident points out that Russia can shut off a gas pipeline, and Lithuanians are understandably concerned that this could happen again.\n\n     The positive side is that natural gas from Russia is an excellent alternative to meet Lithuania's needs, especially in the post-Ignalina shutdown period. The reasoning is set forth in the National Energy Strategy, [6], page 32:\nTechnically and ecologically, natural gas is the most effective fossil fuel with its vast world reserves. Taking into consideration the large resources of Russia's gas fields, the routes of and trends in their export to the West, the existing technical supply facilities and the ever more stringent environmental requirements, natural gas in Lithuania is the most promising kind of fossil fuel during the whole period under review.\n\n     This same viewpoint holds true for Europe as a whole. Increased use of gas from the large supplies in Russia can provide ample amounts of clean fossil fuel to replace the depleting gas supplies from the North Sea, and provide Europe with an energy supply that can help bridge a transition to new and improved forms of energy from renewables or from nuclear power, possibly including fusion, in the latter portion of the 21st century. Natural gas contributes much less carbon dioxide per unit of energy than coal or oil.\n\n     This author's working hypothesis is that the risk of potential interruption in natural gas supply to Lithuania is one of the most important areas for Lithuania's energy planning for the period after the planned shutdown of Ignalina Unit #2 in 2010. As long as Ignalina is still operating, then Lithuania's dependence on natural gas imported from Russia is much reduced. But after the nuclear generation ceases, then Lithuania's electricity supply, as well as other aspects of its energy infrastructure, will depend of natural gas, with perhaps some modest reduction from use of orimulsion and heavy fuel oil. There as yet is no intertie with Poland and the Western European electricity grid, and undersea connection to the Nordic countries (via a 'Baltic Ring') is also still in the planning stage. Both interconnections will be expensive, and it is not clear that these interconnections will be of sufficient capacity to be able to provide enough electricity to make up for a large shortfall in generation in Lithuania.\n\n     Natural gas is not as easily stored as oil, and Lithuania does not yet have an underground storage facility for natural gas. Western Latvia has favorable geology for even larger underground storage. A proposed storage project in Latvia is shown in Figure 2, and underground gas storage projects for Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland are shown among the DG-TREN Trans-European energy projects [16], page 34-35. This document states, 'Gas stocks need to be assured for at least 60 days of normal use.' That will be a difficult requirement to meet in the period after the Ignalina Unit #2 shutdown. Another possible addition is another natural gas pipeline. Adding metering equipment to the pipeline in Latvia would seem like excellent insurance in case there is another interruption in supply through the pipeline through Belarus. An improved pipeline to Kaliningrad is advocated in the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 33). If a spur pipeline were run from the Baltic undersea pipeline to Poland (see dotted line in Figure 2) or Kaliningrad and then into Lithuania, and this line were built at sufficient size, then gas from the new Baltic pipeline from Russia could be moved eastward into Lithuania to assure adequate supply, in case of an interruption of supply through the pipelines to the east of Lithuania. A large two-way pipeline link through Kaliningrad might improve the security of gas supply to Latvia and to other neighboring countries as well.\n\n     What are the main threats to the adequacy of natural gas supply to meet demand? Four categories of such threats might be examined. First, unusual weather such as a prolonged period of extreme cold can lead to increased demand, exceeding available supply, or weather-related equipment failures. Most electric and gas utilities plan for extreme weather, but occasionally shortfalls occur. There have been many examples in the United States, most recently, the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. Second, equipment failures can occur in the absence of severe weather. Such failures become more likely if equipment is not appropriately upgraded and maintained. Compressor stations can fail and gas pipelines can corrode. Third, acts of terrorism or sabotage can lead to loss of facilities. Such actions have become a worldwide concern, and recent events in Russia have demonstrated the ability of terrorists to carry out well planned and sophisticated attacks on schools, airplanes, and police stations. So far there have not been efforts to attack energy infrastructure in Russia. Fourth, supply can be deliberatively interrupted for economic or political reasons -- as happened to Belarus, and Lithuania, in April of 2004.\n\n     Investment in increased gas storage and in additional pipelines can lead to a more robust and secure supply system for natural gas from Russia to meet the needs in Lithuania and other nations of the EU. It is an urgent need for Lithuania, and Lithuania has been promised financial assistance. What configuration of storage and gas transmission lines represents the best investment in achieving adequate security of supply? These projects to construct new pipelines and storage facilities are very expensive, at the level of tens of millions of euros for storage projects to the order of 6 billion euros for the Baltic Undersea natural gas pipeline [16]. What institutional arrangements between EU countries including Lithuania and its New Independent State neighbors (using the language cited above from the Green Paper) are needed to assure that Russia will not unreasonably interrupt supply or charge unreasonably high prices for its gas? These seem like very important issues for the EC to address, and in our review we have not come up with much evidence that the EC energy research centers are addressing these issues with modern analytical tools. We now turn our attention to describing such tools.\n\nIII. Analytical Tools Area #1 ' Probabilistic Risk Analysis. ",
          "\n\n     A shortfall or failure in a complex system often can be described as a scenario, a set of events leading to this failure. Probabilistic models of such event sequences have a long history in statistics and reliability theory. Such approaches were developed in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and then widely applied in these industries and elsewhere. Decision analysis evolved out of statistical decision theory in the aftermath of World War II. In decision analysis, sequences are examined of decisions and uncertain events. A decision tree is often used as a visual display and as a computing device for computing the probability distributions corresponding to different decision alternatives, and then evaluating these to find the best decision [17].\n\n     Influence diagrams evolved from decision trees to deal with situations in which a sequence of events occurs, with a complex structure of conditionality. For example, a series of ten to twenty uncertain events precedes the system failure of interest, and the probabilities assigned to one of these events may depend on some (say, 2 to 6), but not all of the preceding events in the sequence. With binary events, a sequence of ten events leads to a thousand end points or scenarios, and 20 leads to a million. An illustration of such an event tree showing all the possible outcomes becomes impractical. The influence diagram is a schematic form that shows by means of arrows connecting nodes the conditionality structure. The basic idea was developed by Allen C. Miller and colleagues in a military application and first published in unclassified form in [18]. It has achieved widespread use in decision analysis, operations research [19] reliability [20] and also in computer science applications, sometimes under the term, Bayesian nets. A recent application to terrorism by the author's department chairman at Stanford and one of her students is found in [21]. Software packages for influence diagram computations are available from several sources. For the illustrative example below, the author has used Decision Advisor, a propriety software package for R&D management marketed by SmartOrg of Menlo Park, CA.\n\n     We described above that failure of the natural gas supply system to meet gas demand might result from four types of events:\n\n- peak demands and/or reduced supply resulting from extreme weather\n\n- equipment failure for reasons other than extreme weather\n\n- terrorist attacks\n\n- deliberate interruption in supply by the leadership in the supplying country.\n\nLet's place this in the form of an influence diagram, which is shown in Figure 3.\n\n     The arrows show conditionality for dependence of the uncertain events on preceding events. For example, we assume that a failure of the system to meet peak demands as the result of extreme weather depends on whether the extreme weather occurs (and perhaps to what extent) and on the configuration of the pipeline and storage system. An analysis might consider a base case and several alternatives in which additional investment has been made to have storage facilities and one or more additional pipelines from the supplier country. For each system configuration and each of the weather outcomes, a probability is assigned to each of the cases for a supply shortfall. We show below in Figure 4 a decision tree representation: two outcomes for extreme weather (yes and no), three systems configurations (base and two alternatives) and two possibilities for shortfall (shortage and none).\n\n     Obviously, this example is extremely simplified. The approach is capable of using a much more complex structure of conditional events represented as nodes in the influence diagram. For the other three terms, we have conditioned equipment failure only on the configuration decision, and we condition 'terrorist attack' on 'supplier political evolution.' 'Deliberate flow restriction' is also conditioned on what happens in 'supplier political evolution.' This node is intended to describe what might happen politically in Russia during the next 5-15 years, and perhaps in neighboring countries like Belarus as well. A very simple characterization of three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive outcomes might be: continued steady progress in democracy, protracted civil unrest, and reversion to authoritarian imperialism. Probabilities are assigned to each of these outcomes, based on the judgment of experts in the politics of the area. Disagreement among such experts can be expected. Which judgments are most important? Sensitivity analysis can help determine which judgments are most important.\n\n     Moving from left to right and then down the influence diagram, probabilities are assigned to 'terrorist attack,' conditional on which of these outcomes occurs and the system configuration alterative. 'Deliberate flow restriction' is shown conditioned only on 'supplier political evolution.'\n\n     Once the set of conditional probability assignments are complete and outcomes for 'unmet demand' resulting from the four sets of causes are described, then the software can compute probability distributions for each configuration, so that costs and risks of supply interruptions of different time periods and regional impact magnitudes can be compared. An illustrative cumulative distribution is shown below in Figure 5. It shows a moderate probability (about 7%) of a limited shortfall judged to be worth about\n' 1 billion, and a much smaller probability (0.7 %) of a much larger shortfall, valued at\n' 60 billion. Such a disaster would be comparable to the impacts the US is currently experiencing from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. It might plausibly result from a major, extended interruption in Russian gas, perhaps from a series of successful terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or an extreme action, or series of actions by the Russian leadership to reduce supply to European countries.\n\n     Reference [21] describes an application of influence diagrams at a much more sophisticated level of complexity. The structure shown here is intended only as a highly simplistic description of the methodology, for those not familiar with influence diagrams and probabilistic risk analysis. Applications of probabilistic risk analysis to weather and equipment failure are widely carried out by gas and electric utilities. Application to the threat posed by terrorism and political decisions to interrupt supply are not widely practiced. It may be useful to carry out such an analysis as the basis for dialogue among the concerned parties. For example, some parties in Russia may assert that the threat of terrorist attack in Lithuania and other Baltic countries led to a preference for the Baltic Undersea pipeline route over a cheaper overland route.\n\nIV. Analytical Tools Area #2: Energy Models for Long-range Planning ",
          "\n\n     Planning the future of a complex energy system on a time scale of many decades is a daunting challenge. Dating back at least to period in the 1970s when the United States was considering large investments in new energy systems, such computer planning models are increasingly being used by businesses and government agencies. The analysis in [7] involves the use of linear programming, which has been widely applied in the US and internationally.\n\n     Stanford University has since the 1970s had an activity called the Energy Modeling Forum, in which leaders in the field of energy modeling bring their models (often proprietary computer software, developed at considerable investment expense) and come together to analyze case exercises, from regional planning to global response in the context of global climate change. Reference [22] is a report on dealing with natural gas supply in North America. One of the models used in the exercise described in [22], the North American Gas Model (NARG), is a direct descendent of the SRI-Gulf model used for the synthetic fuel commercialization analysis described in [1] and [2]. In [22] this model is being used on behalf of the California Energy Commission; it has also been used for many leading US and international oil and gas companies. The lead modeler, Dale Nesbitt, worked with the author on the 1975 synthetic fuel analysis ([1] and [2]). The generalized equilibrium methodology involves an extension from mathematical programming to finding the fixed point solution x to an equation f(x) = x, where x is a vector of very high dimensionality describing flow quantities and prices of energy materials at different locations in a network connecting energy resources in the ground to energy end use demands, and at different time points from the beginning to the end of the planning horizon [23,24]. The NARG model and its European counterpart, the European Gas Model, are not unique to one vendor. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Rice University have developed similar models based on the generalized equilibrium approach.\n\n     The author takes the position that an understanding of the European energy system, over a period from five to fifteen, perhaps as much as fifty years into the future, will require the use of advanced energy modeling tools. Energy models are particularly useful for projecting changes as energy prices and the availability of energy technologies change over time. The models can also be used to analyze upset conditions, such as those currently prevailing in the US, with numerous refineries and many gas production and processing facilities temporarily out of service because of hurricane damage.\n\nV. Conclusions and Recommendations ",
          "\n\n     The 1975 analysis [1,2] of the US decision on investing billions of dollars to create a million-barrel-per-day industry to make gas and liquid fuels from coal and oil shale showed this investment was a poor idea. It was voted down by Congress under the Ford Administration, but then established under the succeeding Carter Administration. It failed badly, for reasons that were foreseen in the analysis: The increased prices of oil and other energy materials that occurred in the mid-1970s led to reduction in demand and expansion of conventional oil and gas supplies, with the result that there was no market for high-cost synthetic fuel made from shale and coal.\n\n     The analytic tools used for the analysis ([1] and [2]) included a decision tree describing important uncertainties and how future decisions to expand capacity would depend on the immediate decisions to be taken in the mid-1970s. About three thousand scenarios were represented in the decision tree, and across this large number of scenarios (with some approximations via curve fitting) an energy model was used to assess how prices, technology choices, and energy quantities might evolve for that scenario.\n\n     Such tools should be very valuable in helping to understand Lithuania's energy future and the decisions facing Lithuania, the EU, and other organizations that must help Lithuania to finance its transition away from using the inexpensive nuclear electricity from Ignalina. It is the author's impression that the Lithuanian Energy Institute is relatively sophisticated in the use of energy modeling and probabilistic risk assessment. The author is not aware of analysis on behalf of the EU or the EC where such tools are being used, for example, to assist on decisions for determining which alternative pipeline routes should be selected. It is the author's impression that selection of the Baltic Undersea route over the Amber and Yamal-II routes was a bilateral decision by Russia and Germany. Many other countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland have expressed considerable unhappiness over this decision and the way it was made. There was no analysis made transparent through extensive publicly available documentation to inform discussion, debate, and analysis of the alternative pipeline routes. As one who has invested much time in considering how decision analysis can assist difficult decisions on public policy [25,26], this author must recommend that the staff of the EC needs to improve the extent to which it can assist senior policy makers such as the leader of DG-TREN in making decisions affecting the security of Europe's energy supply ' particularly natural gas supply from Russia.\n\n     In the Preface to the National Energy Strategy ([6], page 5), the LEI Director at that time, Professor Jurgis Vilemas, stated, 'Decision-making will hopefully, in the end, be based on economic reasoning, realistic demand forecasts and the latest achievements in development of energy generation technology.' This is an excellent place to start. I believe that Professor Vilemas and his LEI colleagues have also concluded that the reasoning should be broadened from a focus on purely economic reasoning to include the four types of risk issues that have been listed in this paper and illustrated in the simple influence diagram: extreme weather, equipment failure, terrorism and sabotage, and political interference in energy trade. I hope the SEIF-IV participants and the management of DG-TREN will endorse this expanded view on what needs to be done to support good decision making, both in Lithuania and for the EU, of which Lithuania is now a member.\n\nReferences",

Warner North and Stephen H. Schneider\n\nPresentation at the Conference on Global Climate Alteration and Energy Policy\n\nSponsored by the Ministerium fur Umwelt und Verkehr,\n\nState of Baden-Wurttemberg,\n\nStuttgart, Germany, October 11, 2004\n\nIt was a pleasure and privilege for Warner North to replace his Stanford University\n colleague Stephen Schneider on a few days' notice at the Stuttgart\nConference. This written version of the material presented by Dr. North was\nprepared at the request of the conference organizers in the Ministerium fur Umwelt\n und Verkehr Baden-Wurttemberg. It combines Professor Schneider's visual aid materials\n prepared in advance for this conference with additional comments and references\ninserted by Professor North for the oral presentation at the conference. Because of\n space and graphics limitations in the printed Conference Summary, pictures and graphics\n used in the oral presentation are not included, but brief descriptions and references\n to websites are given in the text below.\n\nIn the city of Stuttgart, a world-renowned center of automobile design and manufacturing,\nan American expert on energy and climate might appropriately open his presentation with\nthe American \"Hummer\" H2 sport utility vehicle pictured in an advertisement, with a caption\nthat this vehicle \"does well at the (melting) Poles.\" This picture did indeed begin Professor\nSchneider's visual aid materials and Dr. North's presentation. It illustrates the concern for\nboth recent scientific findings that polar ice is melting at an alarmingly rapid rate and\nthe need for increased energy efficiency and reduced reliance on fossil fuels, policy issues\nfor leaders in business and government in both of our countries.\n\nArticle 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) states that we\nmust prevent dangerous levels of climate change from occurring. This implies a shift in energy\npolicy:\n\nThe ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference\nof the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the\nConvention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that\nwould prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n\nThe UNFCCC further suggests that \"Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient:\n\n to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change,\n\n to ensure that food production is not threatened and\n\n to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.\"\n\nWhat do these requirements mean for Germany, the United States, and other leading industrialized\ncountries? We must consider the emerging knowledge from scientific research of the potential impact\nof increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), which results primarily from the\nburning of coal, oil, and natural gas (fossil fuels) for energy. While other greenhouse gases\ncontribute to climate alteration, and some of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide comes\nfrom deforestation, it is our ongoing reliance on the combustion of fossil fuel that must be\nconsidered the primary candidate for multinational action under the terms of the UNFCC.\nHowever, at early phases of international mitigation actions, considering multiple gases may be\nthe most cost-effective way to initiate abatement.\n\nA number of scientific reports summarize what is known and not known about the potential for\nincreased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to alter the climate. Dr. North\nwas involved in the peer review of two reports prepared by the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (USEPA) to the US Congress fifteen years ago on the potential effects of\nclimate alteration in the US and on mitigation strategies [1,2,3]. The reports of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in which Dr. Schneider has played a large role,\nfollow a similar approach to the USEPA reports [4]. A European audience may find useful the\nreports on climate change and energy policy from the Unites States National Academy of\nSciences [5,6,7].\n\nA report on climate change science [7] was prepared by the National Research Council in a\nthree-week period in 2001 at the request of President George W. Bush's Administration. Like\nprevious reports, it stresses the uncertainty regarding whether the warmer global average\nsurface temperatures observed over the last few decades are due to natural fluctuations in\nthe earth's climate, or, more likely, to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\ngases. The report goes on to stress that continued emissions of greenhouse gases are expected\nto alter climate, although the magnitude and the rate of such alteration remain uncertain.\nThe report states:\n\nGreenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities,\ncausing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are,\nin fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to\nhuman activities**, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a\nreflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are\nexpected to continue through the 21st century. Secondary effects are suggested by computer\nmodel simulations and basic physical reasoning. These include increases in rainfall rates\nand increased susceptibility of semi-arid regions to drought. The impacts of these changes\nwill be critically dependent on the **magnitude of the warming and the rate with which it occurs**.**\n\n ([7], page 1, emphasis added.)\n\nWe shall now try to summarize the important uncertainties surrounding climate change in\nquantitative terms, using a set of emissions scenarios developed by the IPCC [4]. These\nemissions scenarios are projections of world population, socio-economic development, and\ntechnology and process choices, which determine the emissions of carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases from the present through the year 2100. We shall focus on the A1 scenario,\nwhich is a scenario of very rapid world economic growth, with a world population that peaks\nat the middle of the 21st century. We shall compare three possibilities for technological\nchange in the energy sector of the world economy: the A1FI \"fossil intensive\" pathway, the A1B\n\"balanced\" pathway, and the A1T, an advanced \"technology\" pathway in which fossil fuel use is\ngreatly reduced. Under the A1FI scenario, CO2 emissions peak at about 30 gigatons (GT) of\ncarbon annually and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are projected to reach nearly 1000 parts\nper million (ppm) by 2100. Under the A1T scenario, annual CO2 emissions peak at about 12 GT,\nand atmospheric CO2 levels have not reached 600 ppm by 2100. In the \"balanced\" A1B scenario,\nthe concentration of CO2 is projected to reach about 700 ppm by 2100. Even the \"best\"\nA1T, doubles CO2 concentrations by 2100, but at least they are stabilized, whereas A1FI triples\nconcentrations by 2100 and would represent a quadrupling or more in the 22nd century.\n\nWhat difference does it make to earth's climate whether atmospheric CO2 levels reach 1000 ppm or stay below 600 ppm? We should recognize that the impact on climate of such large changes in CO2 and other greenhouse gases is highly uncertain. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now at about 370 ppm, an increase from 280 ppm prior to the industrial revolution in Europe and North America. We have reached levels at which most climate scientists believe that increased greenhouse gas concentrations are contributing to global warming at a level that can be distinguished from natural fluctuations in climate.\n\nThe earth's climate does fluctuate on a time scale of centuries, and such past fluctuations have become an area of intense study [8,9,10,11,12]. From cores taken from Arctic and Antarctic ice, scientists can infer temperature levels and atmospheric levels of CO2 going back through the repeated cycles of glaciation of the past 500,000 years. A look at ice core data for the last 10,000 years (roughly since the last ice age receded and humans developed agriculture) indicates that temperature fluctuations over this period (which are not believed to be more than plus or minus a degree or two Celsius) have still been large enough to have significant impacts on European agriculture and history [8]. Within the past 1,000 years, European climate has warmed, cooled, and then warmed again, as measured from records of how often major rivers froze and where wine grapes could be effectively cultivated [9]. Scientists are in the process of refining quantitative estimates of these past fluctuations, but differences remain in how to interpret the data [10,11,12]. However, what seems clear to most scientists is that continued high levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in climate changes over the next 50 to 100 years that are far greater than those that have occurred in the past ten thousand years of earth's history, during which human civilization emerged.\n\nWe will sketch the process of developing a quantitative description of the uncertainty in future climate change, including the impact of changing emissions of greenhouse gases over the 21st century. To do this, we shall use a simplified measure of climate, the temperature averaged over the entire world and over the seasonal changes through a year (global average surface temperature). Past climate shifts since the ice age ended may have been of the order of one or two degrees Celsius on this scale. Projections of changes in the 21st century range up to about ten degrees Celsius. One widely used probability assessment [13] for the temperature changes resulting from a doubling of the atmospheric loading of CO2 (called climate sensitivity) estimates that there is a 10% probability that the global average temperature would increase by less than 1.1 degrees, and a 10% probability that the increase would be 6.8 degrees or more for a doubling of CO2 [13]. The most likely range of change is in the neighborhood of 2 degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2. In [13] there is a 50% probability that the temperature increase will be less than 2 degrees Celsius, and a 50% probability the temperature increase will exceed 2o C. There is a small probability (5%) of an increase exceeding 10o C for CO2 doubling - a truly catastrophic prospect.\n\nDo climate scientists and other experts agree on such probabilities? As might be expected, the judgments of climate experts differ. Of 16 American experts asked in a study [14] published ten years ago, only one seemed certain that the change in global average temperature from a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels would be small, within the range of historical variation over the past millennium. The others were in general agreement that the change could be much larger. The important insight from this survey is that most scientists think the range of uncertainty on the extent of climate change is very large.\n\nWe will now look at the impact of reducing fossil fuel use by comparing the range of uncertainty in temperature changes for the scenario of continued intensive fossil use to 2100, A1FI, versus the phasing out of fossil fuels, as assumed in A1T. Let us take the 90th percentile estimate of climate sensitivity from [13] of 6.8o C warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Under the fossil phase-out emissions scenario A1T, the 90th percentile estimate gives us temperature increases of 2.5o C by 2025, more than 5o C by 2050, and more than 8o C by 2100. At the median (50%) climate sensitivity, the projected temperature increases are about 1o C by 2025, 2o C by 2050, and 3o C by 2100. The 10th percentile estimate gives a rise of less than 1o C by 2050 and only about 1.5o C by 2100. Now let us compare these numbers to the numbers projected for A1FI. With the 90th percentile estimate of climate sensitivity, the predicted changes in global temperature are about the same as they are in A1T for 2025, and 2050, but they reach 13o C in 2100, compared to 8o C for A1T. The median and 10% estimates for 2025 and 2050 are also similar to those obtained under A1T, but by 2100, they deviate dramatically from A1T: 4.5o C for the median (versus 3o C for A1T) and 2.3o for the 10th percentile estimate (versus 1.5o C for A1T).\n\nThe inference to take away from these numbers is that climate change could be moderate, or it could be quite large. If we were to examine all 40 of the scenarios developed by IPCC for its 2000 report, we would see a wide range of projections for global temperature increase, from a small change on the order of 1o C by 2100 to at least 5o C, or even 10o C! The larger the change that actually occurs, the larger and more complex will be the impacts, and the more difficult it would be for societies or natural systems to adapt. These impacts could include increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, and extreme storms, as well and regional and global alteration in temperature patterns. Most climate models suggest the warming may be most apparent in the high latitudes of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Melting of polar ice, changes in sea levels, and alteration of ocean currents such as the northeastern warm water flow in the Atlantic may occur, especially for warming beyond several degrees. Extensive climate alteration will have large impacts on agriculture and natural ecosystems, leading to changes in the areas suitable for many important food crops, and potential extinction of some species from the rapid alteration of habitat. Many case studies are being done to look at potential impacts in specific areas. Professor Schneider and colleagues have recently carried out one such assessment for California [15]. Many other such assessments are being carried out by scientists throughout the world. But at this time no one can predict accurately how large the climate impacts will be as continued emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases alter the composition of the atmosphere. Research and continuing observation of the earth's climate should allow better understanding to be achieved in coming decades, but given the complexity of the earth's atmosphere and oceans, such better understanding may not come easily or quickly.\n\nThe United States government has an interagency climate research activity, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, whose findings are similar to those of other groups of scientists. In a recent report, the group states:\n\nClimate variability and change can profoundly influence social and natural environments throughout the world, with consequent impacts on natural resources and industry that can be large and far-reaching**. Recent advances in climate science are providing information for decision makers and resource managers to better anticipate and plan for potential impacts of climate variability and change. Further advances will serve the nation by providing improved knowledge **to enable more scientifically informed decisions** across a broad array of climate-sensitive sectors. **\n\n [16], page 42. Emphasis added.\n\nThis and many other assessments make clear that the large uncertainties in the scientific understanding should not be a basis for continuing inaction. Many scientists and energy experts in the United States concluded as early as 1991, in a report produced by the National Research Council, that steps should be taken to adapt energy policy to the threat posed by climate alteration:\n\nDespite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now**. Some current actions could reduce the speed and magnitude of greenhouse warming; others could prepare people and natural systems of plants and animals for future adjustments to the conditions likely to accompany greenhouse warming.**\n\n[5], page 72. Emphasis added.\n\nPolicy makers need to inform themselves about current thinking on climate change, which has been developed through continuing scientific research. The opportunities and challenges of rapid industrialization in China, India, and other areas of the world need to be carefully assessed, because greater use of coal, oil, and gas by growing economies outside Europe and North America could more than offset gains from conservation, increased energy efficiency, and use of renewable energy sources in highly developed countries. Climate alteration is a global problem, and global strategies are needed to deal with it.\n\nPerhaps our most important message is that we need to make policy decisions about our energy future in the face of great uncertainty about what continued high emissions of CO2 imply for climate alteration over the next 50 to 100 years. It seems unlikely that the uncertainty will be resolved quickly -- decades of additional research may be needed. Further, changing the energy sector of the world economy from its present high reliance on fossil fuels to alternative energy sources and higher energy efficiencies will take many decades. The IPCC and many economists and other analysts have therefore adopted the viewpoint of decision making under uncertainty about emissions control, with a focus on the coming 50 to 100 years. One analysis of policy alternatives published in a leading journal since the Stuttgart Conference is an October 2004 article in Science magazine, \"To Hedge or Not Against an Uncertain Climate Future\" [17]. Leaders in the energy sector of the international business community are speaking out on the need to learn and to take appropriate action [18].\n\nMuch more effort will be needed beyond the productive discussion that those present enjoyed in Stuttgart on October 11, 2004. Such effort will be needed in Germany, in the United States, and by leaders throughout the world. Some of us from the United States are pleased to see the Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as a useful first step in international collective action. But far larger emission reductions will be needed to mitigate significant climate alteration if climate sensitivity turns out to be moderate or large, as opposed to very small. Kyoto does not remotely resemble a viable plan to control climate change over a century, though it is an important first step to create the international cooperative actions needed to fashion truly meaningful abatement strategies like those in the A1T scenario. If world governments deem it \"dangerous\" to allow a doubling of CO2, then even stronger actions will be needed than is represented by the A1T scenario. If the world opts for a \"business as usual\" scenario like A1FI, then massive climate changes will have a better than coin-flip (i.e., 50%) odds of occurring by the end of the century. Collectively, we need to continue to enhance the international efforts to provide improved scientific knowledge, and to encourage and enable timely and informed cooperative decisions to manage the future of our planet's climate. One plausible strategy may be to focus first on cost-effective efficiency investments and co-benefits (an example of the latter is replacing a highly polluting coal plant near a population center with a natural gas unit that will not only emit half the CO2 per unit energy, but also will greatly reduce health-damaging aerosols and other pollutants). A search for cost-effective \"win-win\" solutions has the best promise to advance the international dialogue seeking both fair and efficient solutions to the risks imposed by anthropogenic climate change.\n\nReferences: **\n\n[1].

Schneider\n\nPresentation at the Conference on Global Climate Alteration and Energy Policy\n\nSponsored by the Ministerium fur Umwelt und Verkehr,\n\nState of Baden-Wurttemberg,\n\nStuttgart, Germany, October 11, 2004\n\nIt was a pleasure and privilege for Warner North to replace his Stanford University\n colleague Stephen Schneider on a few days' notice at the Stuttgart\nConference. This written version of the material presented by Dr. North was\nprepared at the request of the conference organizers in the Ministerium fur Umwelt\n und Verkehr Baden-Wurttemberg. It combines Professor Schneider's visual aid materials\n prepared in advance for this conference with additional comments and references\ninserted by Professor North for the oral presentation at the conference. Because of\n space and graphics limitations in the printed Conference Summary, pictures and graphics\n used in the oral presentation are not included, but brief descriptions and references\n to websites are given in the text below.\n\nIn the city of Stuttgart, a world-renowned center of automobile design and manufacturing,\nan American expert on energy and climate might appropriately open his presentation with\nthe American Hummer H2 sport utility vehicle pictured in an advertisement, with a caption\nthat this vehicle does well at the (melting) Poles. This picture did indeed begin Professor\nSchneider's visual aid materials and Dr. North's presentation. It illustrates the concern for\nboth recent scientific findings that polar ice is melting at an alarmingly rapid rate and\nthe need for increased energy efficiency and reduced reliance on fossil fuels, policy issues\nfor leaders in business and government in both of our countries.\n\nArticle 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) states that we\nmust prevent dangerous levels of climate change from occurring. This implies a shift in energy\npolicy:\n\nThe ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference\nof the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the\nConvention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that\nwould prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n\nThe UNFCCC further suggests that Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient:\n\n to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change,\n\n to ensure that food production is not threatened and\n\n to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.\n\nWhat do these requirements mean for Germany, the United States, and other leading industrialized\ncountries? We must consider the emerging knowledge from scientific research of the potential impact\nof increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), which results primarily from the\nburning of coal, oil, and natural gas (fossil fuels) for energy. While other greenhouse gases\ncontribute to climate alteration, and some of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide comes\nfrom deforestation, it is our ongoing reliance on the combustion of fossil fuel that must be\nconsidered the primary candidate for multinational action under the terms of the UNFCC.\nHowever, at early phases of international mitigation actions, considering multiple gases may be\nthe most cost-effective way to initiate abatement.\n\nA number of scientific reports summarize what is known and not known about the potential for\nincreased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to alter the climate. Dr. North\nwas involved in the peer review of two reports prepared by the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (USEPA) to the US Congress fifteen years ago on the potential effects of\nclimate alteration in the US and on mitigation strategies [1,2,3]. The reports of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in which Dr. Schneider has played a large role,\nfollow a similar approach to the USEPA reports [4]. A European audience may find useful the\nreports on climate change and energy policy from the Unites States National Academy of\nSciences [5,6,7].\n\nA report on climate change science [7] was prepared by the National Research Council in a\nthree-week period in 2001 at the request of President George W. Bush's Administration. Like\nprevious reports, it stresses the uncertainty regarding whether the warmer global average\nsurface temperatures observed over the last few decades are due to natural fluctuations in\nthe earth's climate, or, more likely, to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\ngases. The report goes on to stress that continued emissions of greenhouse gases are expected\nto alter climate, although the magnitude and the rate of such alteration remain uncertain.\nThe report states:\n\nGreenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities,\ncausing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are,\nin fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to\nhuman activities",
          ", but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a\nreflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are\nexpected to continue through the 21st century. Secondary effects are suggested by computer\nmodel simulations and basic physical reasoning. These include increases in rainfall rates\nand increased susceptibility of semi-arid regions to drought. The impacts of these changes\nwill be critically dependent on the ",
          "magnitude of the warming and the rate with which it occurs",
          ".",
          "\n\n ([7], page 1, emphasis added.)\n\nWe shall now try to summarize the important uncertainties surrounding climate change in\nquantitative terms, using a set of emissions scenarios developed by the IPCC [4]. These\nemissions scenarios are projections of world population, socio-economic development, and\ntechnology and process choices, which determine the emissions of carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases from the present through the year 2100. We shall focus on the A1 scenario,\nwhich is a scenario of very rapid world economic growth, with a world population that peaks\nat the middle of the 21st century. We shall compare three possibilities for technological\nchange in the energy sector of the world economy: the A1FI fossil intensive pathway, the A1B\nbalanced pathway, and the A1T, an advanced technology pathway in which fossil fuel use is\ngreatly reduced. Under the A1FI scenario, CO2 emissions peak at about 30 gigatons (GT) of\ncarbon annually and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are projected to reach nearly 1000 parts\nper million (ppm) by 2100. Under the A1T scenario, annual CO2 emissions peak at about 12 GT,\nand atmospheric CO2 levels have not reached 600 ppm by 2100. In the balanced A1B scenario,\nthe concentration of CO2 is projected to reach about 700 ppm by 2100. Even the best\nA1T, doubles CO2 concentrations by 2100, but at least they are stabilized, whereas A1FI triples\nconcentrations by 2100 and would represent a quadrupling or more in the 22nd century.\n\nWhat difference does it make to earth's climate whether atmospheric CO2 levels reach 1000 ppm or stay below 600 ppm? We should recognize that the impact on climate of such large changes in CO2 and other greenhouse gases is highly uncertain. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now at about 370 ppm, an increase from 280 ppm prior to the industrial revolution in Europe and North America. We have reached levels at which most climate scientists believe that increased greenhouse gas concentrations are contributing to global warming at a level that can be distinguished from natural fluctuations in climate.\n\nThe earth's climate does fluctuate on a time scale of centuries, and such past fluctuations have become an area of intense study [8,9,10,11,12]. From cores taken from Arctic and Antarctic ice, scientists can infer temperature levels and atmospheric levels of CO2 going back through the repeated cycles of glaciation of the past 500,000 years. A look at ice core data for the last 10,000 years (roughly since the last ice age receded and humans developed agriculture) indicates that temperature fluctuations over this period (which are not believed to be more than plus or minus a degree or two Celsius) have still been large enough to have significant impacts on European agriculture and history [8]. Within the past 1,000 years, European climate has warmed, cooled, and then warmed again, as measured from records of how often major rivers froze and where wine grapes could be effectively cultivated [9]. Scientists are in the process of refining quantitative estimates of these past fluctuations, but differences remain in how to interpret the data [10,11,12]. However, what seems clear to most scientists is that continued high levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in climate changes over the next 50 to 100 years that are far greater than those that have occurred in the past ten thousand years of earth's history, during which human civilization emerged.\n\nWe will sketch the process of developing a quantitative description of the uncertainty in future climate change, including the impact of changing emissions of greenhouse gases over the 21st century. To do this, we shall use a simplified measure of climate, the temperature averaged over the entire world and over the seasonal changes through a year (global average surface temperature). Past climate shifts since the ice age ended may have been of the order of one or two degrees Celsius on this scale. Projections of changes in the 21st century range up to about ten degrees Celsius. One widely used probability assessment [13] for the temperature changes resulting from a doubling of the atmospheric loading of CO2 (called climate sensitivity) estimates that there is a 10% probability that the global average temperature would increase by less than 1.1 degrees, and a 10% probability that the increase would be 6.8 degrees or more for a doubling of CO2 [13]. The most likely range of change is in the neighborhood of 2 degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2. In [13] there is a 50% probability that the temperature increase will be less than 2 degrees Celsius, and a 50% probability the temperature increase will exceed 2o C. There is a small probability (5%) of an increase exceeding 10o C for CO2 doubling - a truly catastrophic prospect.\n\nDo climate scientists and other experts agree on such probabilities? As might be expected, the judgments of climate experts differ. Of 16 American experts asked in a study [14] published ten years ago, only one seemed certain that the change in global average temperature from a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels would be small, within the range of historical variation over the past millennium. The others were in general agreement that the change could be much larger. The important insight from this survey is that most scientists think the range of uncertainty on the extent of climate change is very large.\n\nWe will now look at the impact of reducing fossil fuel use by comparing the range of uncertainty in temperature changes for the scenario of continued intensive fossil use to 2100, A1FI, versus the phasing out of fossil fuels, as assumed in A1T. Let us take the 90th percentile estimate of climate sensitivity from [13] of 6.8o C warming from a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Under the fossil phase-out emissions scenario A1T, the 90th percentile estimate gives us temperature increases of 2.5o C by 2025, more than 5o C by 2050, and more than 8o C by 2100. At the median (50%) climate sensitivity, the projected temperature increases are about 1o C by 2025, 2o C by 2050, and 3o C by 2100. The 10th percentile estimate gives a rise of less than 1o C by 2050 and only about 1.5o C by 2100. Now let us compare these numbers to the numbers projected for A1FI. With the 90th percentile estimate of climate sensitivity, the predicted changes in global temperature are about the same as they are in A1T for 2025, and 2050, but they reach 13o C in 2100, compared to 8o C for A1T. The median and 10% estimates for 2025 and 2050 are also similar to those obtained under A1T, but by 2100, they deviate dramatically from A1T: 4.5o C for the median (versus 3o C for A1T) and 2.3o for the 10th percentile estimate (versus 1.5o C for A1T).\n\nThe inference to take away from these numbers is that climate change could be moderate, or it could be quite large. If we were to examine all 40 of the scenarios developed by IPCC for its 2000 report, we would see a wide range of projections for global temperature increase, from a small change on the order of 1o C by 2100 to at least 5o C, or even 10o C! The larger the change that actually occurs, the larger and more complex will be the impacts, and the more difficult it would be for societies or natural systems to adapt. These impacts could include increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, and extreme storms, as well and regional and global alteration in temperature patterns. Most climate models suggest the warming may be most apparent in the high latitudes of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Melting of polar ice, changes in sea levels, and alteration of ocean currents such as the northeastern warm water flow in the Atlantic may occur, especially for warming beyond several degrees. Extensive climate alteration will have large impacts on agriculture and natural ecosystems, leading to changes in the areas suitable for many important food crops, and potential extinction of some species from the rapid alteration of habitat. Many case studies are being done to look at potential impacts in specific areas. Professor Schneider and colleagues have recently carried out one such assessment for California [15]. Many other such assessments are being carried out by scientists throughout the world. But at this time no one can predict accurately how large the climate impacts will be as continued emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases alter the composition of the atmosphere. Research and continuing observation of the earth's climate should allow better understanding to be achieved in coming decades, but given the complexity of the earth's atmosphere and oceans, such better understanding may not come easily or quickly.\n\nThe United States government has an interagency climate research activity, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, whose findings are similar to those of other groups of scientists. In a recent report, the group states:\n\nClimate variability and change can profoundly influence social and natural environments throughout the world, with consequent impacts on natural resources and industry that can be large and far-reaching",
          ". Recent advances in climate science are providing information for decision makers and resource managers to better anticipate and plan for potential impacts of climate variability and change. Further advances will serve the nation by providing improved knowledge ",
          "to enable more scientifically informed decisions",
          " across a broad array of climate-sensitive sectors. ",
          "\n\n [16], page 42. Emphasis added.\n\nThis and many other assessments make clear that the large uncertainties in the scientific understanding should not be a basis for continuing inaction. Many scientists and energy experts in the United States concluded as early as 1991, in a report produced by the National Research Council, that steps should be taken to adapt energy policy to the threat posed by climate alteration:\n\nDespite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now",
          ". Some current actions could reduce the speed and magnitude of greenhouse warming; others could prepare people and natural systems of plants and animals for future adjustments to the conditions likely to accompany greenhouse warming.",
          "\n\n[5], page 72. Emphasis added.\n\nPolicy makers need to inform themselves about current thinking on climate change, which has been developed through continuing scientific research. The opportunities and challenges of rapid industrialization in China, India, and other areas of the world need to be carefully assessed, because greater use of coal, oil, and gas by growing economies outside Europe and North America could more than offset gains from conservation, increased energy efficiency, and use of renewable energy sources in highly developed countries. Climate alteration is a global problem, and global strategies are needed to deal with it.\n\nPerhaps our most important message is that we need to make policy decisions about our energy future in the face of great uncertainty about what continued high emissions of CO2 imply for climate alteration over the next 50 to 100 years. It seems unlikely that the uncertainty will be resolved quickly -- decades of additional research may be needed. Further, changing the energy sector of the world economy from its present high reliance on fossil fuels to alternative energy sources and higher energy efficiencies will take many decades. The IPCC and many economists and other analysts have therefore adopted the viewpoint of decision making under uncertainty about emissions control, with a focus on the coming 50 to 100 years. One analysis of policy alternatives published in a leading journal since the Stuttgart Conference is an October 2004 article in Science magazine, To Hedge or Not Against an Uncertain Climate Future [17]. Leaders in the energy sector of the international business community are speaking out on the need to learn and to take appropriate action [18].\n\nMuch more effort will be needed beyond the productive discussion that those present enjoyed in Stuttgart on October 11, 2004. Such effort will be needed in Germany, in the United States, and by leaders throughout the world. Some of us from the United States are pleased to see the Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as a useful first step in international collective action. But far larger emission reductions will be needed to mitigate significant climate alteration if climate sensitivity turns out to be moderate or large, as opposed to very small. Kyoto does not remotely resemble a viable plan to control climate change over a century, though it is an important first step to create the international cooperative actions needed to fashion truly meaningful abatement strategies like those in the A1T scenario. If world governments deem it dangerous to allow a doubling of CO2, then even stronger actions will be needed than is represented by the A1T scenario. If the world opts for a business as usual scenario like A1FI, then massive climate changes will have a better than coin-flip (i.e., 50%) odds of occurring by the end of the century. Collectively, we need to continue to enhance the international efforts to provide improved scientific knowledge, and to encourage and enable timely and informed cooperative decisions to manage the future of our planet's climate. One plausible strategy may be to focus first on cost-effective efficiency investments and co-benefits (an example of the latter is replacing a highly polluting coal plant near a population center with a natural gas unit that will not only emit half the CO2 per unit energy, but also will greatly reduce health-damaging aerosols and other pollutants). A search for cost-effective win-win solutions has the best promise to advance the international dialogue seeking both fair and efficient solutions to the risks imposed by anthropogenic climate change.\n\nReferences: ",

Warner North****\n\nNorthWorks, Inc., Belmont CA, USA; and\nDepartment of Management Science and Engineering,\nStanford University,\nStanford, CA USA\n\nPaper presented at the\nRIMS-2006 VNIIGAZ/GAZPROM Conference, Moscow, Russia, February 1-2, 2006\n(Minor editorial changes have been made subequent to this conference.)\n\nAbstract**\n\nThis paper provides a brief introductory summary of methodologies that have been used in the United States for long-term planning of large energy investments that require extensive capital investment and development of technology. It is expected that such methods may be useful to GAZPROM and to its export customers in connection with planning and financing development of additional gas fields in the high arctic area of Russia and pipeline construction to bring such gas to export markets, such as the Baltic countries and other portions of Western Europe. There are two methodologies involved: (1) the use of probabilistic scenario analysis to examine changes in market conditions, including political events that may limit or disrupt energy supply to customers; (2) the use of large-scale energy models that project how market conditions including energy prices and the mix of energy materials may evolve under specific scenarios. The example presented will be the analysis prepared for the US Presidential Task Force in 1975, when the US Government was considering a massive investment in new facilities to make liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and oil shale. This program was subsequently implemented, proved to be a market failure, and was therefore discontinued. The reasons for the market failure were clearly evident in the 1975 analysis. The author will present a retrospective review of this 1975 analysis, in which he was a participant, and an update on the energy modeling and probabilistic scenario methodologies as these have evolved in thirty years of subsequent use by US energy and risk specialists.\n**\n\nI.   History and Background****\n\n     At the midpoint of the first decade of the 21st century, oil and gas resources are depleting. Western Europe will need increasing amounts of imported oil and gas to meet its energy needs. There are also special situations. For example, the government of Lithuania has agreed as a condition for its membership in the European Union to shut down the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) [1]. This plant has two 1500 MW nuclear generating units of the graphite channel (RBMK-2) type, the same design as for the Chernobyl NPP in the Ukraine. Ignalina NPP was built during the time of the Soviet Union to provide electricity for the Baltic region, and it became a part of Lithuania when Lithuania became an independent country. Its 3000 MW generation capacity has allowed Lithuania to meet most of its own needs for electricity from this NPP and also to export large amounts of electricity to Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. Unit one was shut down at the end of 2004. The second unit is scheduled to be shut down in 2009. Shutting down these two nuclear units will require that this electric generation be replaced by other energy sources, such as natural gas from Russia or a heavy oil/water mixture called orimulsion from Venezuela.\n\n     Increased reliance by European countries on natural gas from Russia has positive features for these countries and also for Russia. Russia has extremely large natural gas resources that can be developed and transported to European countries for costs that should be competitive with other energy sources. Natural gas does not contain sulfur, nitrogen, metals, or complex hydrocarbons, so control of air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter is inherently much more easily accomplished; pollution control equipment is needed only for management of oxides of nitrogen formed from atmospheric nitrogen in the combustion process. The low carbon content of natural gas compared to oil and coal implies lower levels of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, compared to burning coal or oil. More use of natural gas, instead of coal or oil, therefore reduces global climate alteration. For these reasons natural gas will increasingly be viewed as a premium fuel, for which customers are willing to pay a higher price. Production areas of natural gas in Western Europe such as in the North Sea are depleting, and large new gas resources are unlikely to be discovered. Russia is known to have very large gas resources that are only now beginning to be developed, such as the Shtokman field. These resources could provide ample supplies for European consumers for much of the 21st century, and may permit export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to North America as well. [2]\n\n     Development of Russian natural gas for export to European countries will require considerable capital expenditure, including the construction of new pipelines and development of gas fields in the arctic region. While agreement was reached between GAZPROM and German companies last year to construct a new gas pipeline to provide Russian gas to Germany, the Baltic countries and Poland expressed concern that this pipeline would bypass them and leave them dependent on single pipelines from Russia. The countries would have preferred an alternative overland route. The 2004 interruption of gas supply to Belarus and the New Year's Day interruption of gas supply to the Ukraine, and the recent terrorist attacks on the pipelines to Georgia have increased concerns among Europeans that the supply of gas from Russia may not be reliable. Events such as equipment breakdowns and extreme weather can lead to supply interruptions. The planning of the multibillion dollar investments in gas field development and pipeline construction will depend on perceptions that (1) the price of the natural gas to customers will be competitive with other energy sources, and (2) that supplies will be reliable. There must be assurances that neither politically motivated shutdowns, equipment failures, extreme weather, or acts of terrorism or war will disrupt the transport of gas essential for heating and continued function of the economy in countries depending on natural gas imports. Alternative supplies energy are available to Europe through North Africa, the Middle East, and possibly from Central Asia, especially as new pipelines or LNG facilities are constructed.\n\n     What is needed for planning is methodology to deal with two issues: (1) a way of assessing the competition in price between gas from Russia and other energy materials for meeting the needs of European countries, looking forward for decades (2) a way to assess the uncertainties arising from weather, equipment failures, and political events to plan adequate redundancy in the energy supply system to that the probability of significant supply interruption can be made acceptably low. Multiple natural gas pipelines connecting gas fields to customers, underground gas storage located in customer countries, and provision to obtain and use other supplies under upset conditions may be needed to assure adequate supply reliability. The cost of these facilities needed for adequate supply reliability should be included in calculating what it will cost to provide gas from Russia to serve export markets in Europe. Therefore, the two issues must be linked.\n\nII.  Methodology Needed****\n\n     How can these planning needs be met? In this paper the author shares experience from applications within the United States of risk and decision analysis, in the belief that such experience may be useful for those in Russia and in Europe responsible for planning GAZPROM's future and a reliable supply of energy to meet European energy needs. In the 1970s the author was involved in a number of energy planning studies in the United States, including the analysis of a major Presidential initiative to create a one million barrels-per-day synthetic fuel capability within ten years [3,4], and a comparison of the economic and social costs of coal and nuclear generation [5]. The author was also involved in a pioneering application of decision analysis to political events in the Persian Gulf area that might impact on the reliability of energy supply from that region [6]. The influence diagram methods developed in that project are described in a recently published pair of journal articles [7.8]. The author also chaired the review of the first set of reports to the US Congress on global climate change, for the Science Advisory Board of the US Environmental Protection Agency [9]. In October of 2004 the author substituted on short notice for his Stanford University colleague, Professor Stephen Schneider, in giving a presentation on global climate alteration in Stuttgart, at a meeting organized by the Minister of Transport and Energy of the State of Baden-W'rttemberg [10]. Especially in the roundtable discussion that followed the presentations, which included leaders of German industry and representatives from the German Bundestag, the author became persuaded that formal analysis of the kind done in the United States in the 1970s would be very helpful in Europe.\n\n     _Analytical Tools Area #1 ' Probabilistic Risk Analysis:_ A shortfall or failure in a complex system often can be described as a scenario, a set of events leading to this failure. Probabilistic models of such event sequences have a long history in statistics and reliability theory. Such approaches were developed in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and then widely applied in these industries and elsewhere. Decision analysis evolved out of statistical decision theory in the aftermath of World War II. In decision analysis, sequences are examined of decisions and uncertain events. A decision tree is often used as a visual display and as a computing device for computing the probability distributions corresponding to different decision alternatives, and then evaluating these to find the best decision. [11].\n\n     Influence diagrams [6,7,8] evolved from decision trees to deal with situations in the sequence of decisions and events has a complex structure of conditionality. For example, a series of ten to twenty uncertain events precedes the system failure of interest, and the probabilities assigned to one of these events may depend on some (say, 2 to 6), but not all of the preceding events and decisions in the sequence. With binary (two possible outcomes) events, a sequence of ten events leads to a thousand end points or scenarios, and 20 leads to a million. An illustration of such a tree showing all the possible outcomes becomes impractical except in a generic form. The influence diagram is a schematic form that shows by means of arrows connecting decisions and events (collectively referred to as 'nodes') the conditionality structure. Influence diagrams have achieved widespread use in decision analysis, operations research [12] reliability [13] and also in computer science applications, sometimes under the term, Bayesian nets. A recent application to protection against terrorism by the author's department chairman at Stanford and one of her students is found in [14]. Software packages for influence diagram computations are available from several sources. For the illustrative example below, the author has used [Decision Advisor](http://www.smartorg.com/decisionadvisor.html), a propriety software package for R&D management marketed by [SmartOrg](http://www.smartorg.com) of Menlo Park, California, USA.\n\nFailure of the natural gas supply system to meet gas demand might result from four types of events:\n\n- peak demands and/or reduced supply resulting from extreme weather\n\n- equipment failure for reasons other than extreme weather\n\n- terrorist attacks\n\n- deliberate interruption in supply by the leadership in the supplying country.\n\nAn influence diagram is shown in Figure 1.\n\n     The arrows show conditionality for dependence of the uncertain events on preceding events. For example, we assume that a failure of the system to meet peak demands as the result of extreme weather depends on whether the extreme weather occurs (and perhaps to what extent) and on the configuration of the pipeline and storage system. An analysis might consider a base case and several alternatives in which additional investment has been made to have storage facilities and one or more additional pipelines from the supplier country. For each system configuration and each of the weather outcomes, a probability is assigned to each of the cases for a supply shortfall. We show below in Figure 2 a decision tree representation: two outcomes for extreme weather (yes and no), three systems configurations (base and two alternatives) and two possibilities for shortfall (shortage and none).\n\n     Moving from left to right and then down the influence diagram in Fig 1, probabilities are assigned to 'terrorist attack,' conditional on which of these outcomes occurs and the system configuration alterative. 'Deliberate flow restriction' is shown conditioned only on 'supplier political evolution.' Once probabilities are assigned to all the possible outcomes for each event and decision, a composite probability can be computed for each possible path or scenario. Figure 3 shows the probability distribution computed for illustrative numbers in this highly simplified influence diagram.\n\n     The approach is capable of using a much more complex structure of decisions and uncertain events conditionally dependent on preceding decisions and events (nodes) in the influence diagram. For the other three terms, we have conditioned equipment failure only on the configuration decision, and we condition 'terrorist attack' on 'supplier political evolution.' 'Deliberate flow restriction' is also conditioned on what happens in 'supplier political evolution.' This node is intended to describe what might happen politically in eastern European countries during the next 5-15 years. A very simple characterization of three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive outcomes for one or more countries might be: continued steady progress in democracy, protracted civil unrest, and reversion to authoritarian imperialism. Probabilities may be assigned to each of these outcomes, based on the judgment of experts in the politics of the area. Disagreement among such experts can be expected. Which judgments are most important? Sensitivity analysis can help determine which judgments are most important in influencing the overall probability of supply interruption and its economic and social consequences.\n\n     Once the set of conditional probability assignments are complete and outcomes for 'unmet demand' resulting from the four sets of causes are described, then the software can compute probability distributions for each configuration, so that costs and risks of supply interruptions of different time periods and regional impact magnitudes can be compared. An illustrative cumulative distribution is shown below in Figure 3. It shows a moderate probability (about 7%) of a limited shortfall judged to be worth about\n' 1 billion, and a much smaller probability (0.7 %) of a much larger shortfall, valued at\n' 60 billion. Such a disaster would be comparable to the impacts the US has experienced from the Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005. A disaster of this magnitude might plausibly result from a major, extended interruption, perhaps from a series of successful terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or an extreme action, or series of actions to reduce supply from gas sources and deliberate shutdown of pipelines.\n\n     The structure shown in Figure 1 here is intended only as a highly simplistic description of the methodology, for those not familiar with influence diagrams and probabilistic risk analysis. Applications of probabilistic risk analysis to weather and equipment failure are widely carried out by gas and electric utilities. Application to the threat posed by terrorism and political decisions to interrupt supply are not widely practiced. It may be useful to carry out such an analysis as the basis for dialogue among the concerned parties. For example, some parties in Russia may assert that the threat of terrorist attack in Lithuania and other Baltic countries led to a preference for the Baltic undersea pipeline route over the cheaper overland route. Figure 4 and influence diagrams of similar complexity in [14] illustrate how complex sequences of events may be represented suing influence diagrams as a means of assessment expert judgment for probabilistic risk analysis.\n\n     _Analytical Tools Area #2: Energy Models for Long-range Planning:_ Planning the future of a complex energy system on a time scale of many decades is a daunting challenge. Dating back at least to period in the 1970s when the United States was considering large investments in new energy systems, such computer planning models are increasingly being used by businesses and government agencies.\n\n     Stanford University has since the 1970s had an activity called the Energy Modeling Forum, in which leaders in the field of energy modeling bring their models (often proprietary computer software, developed at considerable investment expense) and come together to analyze case exercises, from regional planning to global response in the context of global climate change. Reference [15] is a report on dealing with natural gas supply in North America. One of the models used in the exercise described in [15], the North American Gas Model (NARG), is a direct descendent of the SRI-Gulf model used for the synthetic fuel commercialization analysis described in [3] and [4]. In [15] this model was being used on behalf of the California Energy Commission; it has also been used for many leading US and international oil and gas companies. The lead modeler, [Dale Nesbitt](http://www.altosmgmt.com/dale.htm), worked with the author on the 1975 synthetic fuel analysis ([3] and [4]). The generalized equilibrium methodology involves an extension from mathematical programming to finding the fixed point solution x to an equation f(x) = x, where x is a vector of very high dimensionality describing flow quantities and prices of energy materials at different locations in a network connecting energy resources in the ground to energy end use demands, and at different time points from the beginning to the end of the planning horizon [16,17]. The NARG model and its European counterpart, the European Gas Model, are not unique to one vendor. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Rice University have developed similar models based on the generalized equilibrium approach. Other modeling and simulation approaches can be used to forecast how the competition may evolve between natural gas from Russia, natural gas from other sources, and competing fuels and technologies for meeting Europe's needs.\n\n     Understanding how the European energy system may evolve over a period from now to the middle of the twenty-first century can be greatly aided by the use of advanced energy modeling tools. Energy models are particularly useful for projecting changes as energy prices and the availability of energy technologies change over time. The models can also be used to analyze upset conditions, such as those that occurred in the US during the last half of 2005 because of hurricane damage.\n\nIII.  Combining Both Analytical Tool Areas: the 1975 Synthetic Fuels Analysis****\n\n     The 1975 analysis [3,4] of the US decision on investing billions of dollars to create a million-barrel-per-day industry to make gas and liquid fuels from coal and oil shale showed that this investment was a poor idea. The program proposed in the President's State of the Union was first scaled down to a smaller program of one commercial scale plant of each technology, a total capacity of 1/3 of a million barrels per day. This smaller program was proposed by President Gerald Ford but voted down by the US Congress. Under the next President, Jimmy Carter, a small synthetic fuels program was established. The program failed badly, for reasons that were foreseen in the analysis: The increased prices of oil and other energy materials that occurred in the mid-1970s led to reduction in demand, and also to expansion of conventional oil and gas supplies, with the result that there was no market for high-cost synthetic fuel made from shale and coal. The Great Plains Coal Gasification plant was built, but it was not able to sell its gas product, because the price of gas was below the operating cost to produce gas from this plant. There was no return of profit to offset the high capital cost of the plant. The plant was therefore abandoned, with the loss of the capital cost of its construction at the expense of the US government.\n\n     The analytic tools used for the analysis ([3] and [4]) included the decision tree shown in Figure 5 describing important uncertainties and how future decisions to expand capacity would depend on the immediate decisions to be taken in the mid-1970s. Many thousands of scenarios were represented in the decision tree, and across this large number of scenarios (with some approximations via curve fitting) an energy model was used to assess how prices, technology choices, and energy quantities might evolve for that scenario.\n\n     A number of other analyses were carried out in the US in the late 1970s using multiple scenarios and energy models. A review of some of these analyses appears in [18]. The synthetic fuels analysis was one of the most elaborate, and it was tightly focused toward one specific government policy decision. It should be a useful example to Russian and European Union experts in analysis of specific alternatives, such as new pipelines and LNG transport facilities, for supplying reliable natural gas and other energy materials to Europe in the coming decades.\n\nIV. Needs for Future Planning and Decision Making****\n\n     In planning Europe's energy future, the leadership in energy companies and governments need to work effectively together, and to overcome legacies of mistrust and misunderstanding that come from many historical events and from differences in institutions and cultures. Effective planning and decision making require not only the mastery of analytical methods for dealing with the complexity and uncertainty of energy markets and technological development, but also learning how effective governance can be achieved among a multiplicity of stakeholders ' national governments, the European Union and the G-8, energy companies, and concerned citizens in many countries. It is not just a technical problem - it is also an extreme social and political challenge! Several recent reports have suggested how decision analysis methods can support improvements in risk governance in order to improve the transparency and effectiveness of national and international dialogue [19, 20, 21].\n\n     In the Preface to the National Energy Strategy for Lithuania ([1], page 5), Dr. Jurgis Vilemas writes, 'Decision-making will hopefully, in the end, be based on economic reasoning, realistic demand forecasts and the latest achievements in development of energy generation technology.' This is an excellent place for planning to start, and the author looks forward to working with Dr. Vilemas and his colleagues on a study of how to meet the energy needs of the Baltic Region. This analysis will be broadened from a focus on purely economic reasoning to include the four types of risk issues that have been listed in this paper and illustrated in the simple influence diagram: extreme weather, equipment failure, terrorism and sabotage, and political interference in energy trade. The author hopes that the RIMS-2006 participants, the management of VNIIGAZ and GAZPROM, and the leadership of energy planning for Europe share this expanded view on what needs to be done to support good decision making for the energy future of Russia and Europe.\n\nReferences****\n\n[1].

          "\n\nNorthWorks, Inc., Belmont CA, USA; and\nDepartment of Management Science and Engineering,\nStanford University,\nStanford, CA USA\n\nPaper presented at the\nRIMS-2006 VNIIGAZ/GAZPROM Conference, Moscow, Russia, February 1-2, 2006\n(Minor editorial changes have been made subequent to this conference.)\n\nAbstract",
          "\n\nThis paper provides a brief introductory summary of methodologies that have been used in the United States for long-term planning of large energy investments that require extensive capital investment and development of technology. It is expected that such methods may be useful to GAZPROM and to its export customers in connection with planning and financing development of additional gas fields in the high arctic area of Russia and pipeline construction to bring such gas to export markets, such as the Baltic countries and other portions of Western Europe. There are two methodologies involved: (1) the use of probabilistic scenario analysis to examine changes in market conditions, including political events that may limit or disrupt energy supply to customers; (2) the use of large-scale energy models that project how market conditions including energy prices and the mix of energy materials may evolve under specific scenarios. The example presented will be the analysis prepared for the US Presidential Task Force in 1975, when the US Government was considering a massive investment in new facilities to make liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and oil shale. This program was subsequently implemented, proved to be a market failure, and was therefore discontinued. The reasons for the market failure were clearly evident in the 1975 analysis. The author will present a retrospective review of this 1975 analysis, in which he was a participant, and an update on the energy modeling and probabilistic scenario methodologies as these have evolved in thirty years of subsequent use by US energy and risk specialists.\n",
          "\n\nI.   History and Background",
          "\n\n     At the midpoint of the first decade of the 21st century, oil and gas resources are depleting. Western Europe will need increasing amounts of imported oil and gas to meet its energy needs. There are also special situations. For example, the government of Lithuania has agreed as a condition for its membership in the European Union to shut down the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) [1]. This plant has two 1500 MW nuclear generating units of the graphite channel (RBMK-2) type, the same design as for the Chernobyl NPP in the Ukraine. Ignalina NPP was built during the time of the Soviet Union to provide electricity for the Baltic region, and it became a part of Lithuania when Lithuania became an independent country. Its 3000 MW generation capacity has allowed Lithuania to meet most of its own needs for electricity from this NPP and also to export large amounts of electricity to Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. Unit one was shut down at the end of 2004. The second unit is scheduled to be shut down in 2009. Shutting down these two nuclear units will require that this electric generation be replaced by other energy sources, such as natural gas from Russia or a heavy oil/water mixture called orimulsion from Venezuela.\n\n     Increased reliance by European countries on natural gas from Russia has positive features for these countries and also for Russia. Russia has extremely large natural gas resources that can be developed and transported to European countries for costs that should be competitive with other energy sources. Natural gas does not contain sulfur, nitrogen, metals, or complex hydrocarbons, so control of air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter is inherently much more easily accomplished; pollution control equipment is needed only for management of oxides of nitrogen formed from atmospheric nitrogen in the combustion process. The low carbon content of natural gas compared to oil and coal implies lower levels of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, compared to burning coal or oil. More use of natural gas, instead of coal or oil, therefore reduces global climate alteration. For these reasons natural gas will increasingly be viewed as a premium fuel, for which customers are willing to pay a higher price. Production areas of natural gas in Western Europe such as in the North Sea are depleting, and large new gas resources are unlikely to be discovered. Russia is known to have very large gas resources that are only now beginning to be developed, such as the Shtokman field. These resources could provide ample supplies for European consumers for much of the 21st century, and may permit export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to North America as well. [2]\n\n     Development of Russian natural gas for export to European countries will require considerable capital expenditure, including the construction of new pipelines and development of gas fields in the arctic region. While agreement was reached between GAZPROM and German companies last year to construct a new gas pipeline to provide Russian gas to Germany, the Baltic countries and Poland expressed concern that this pipeline would bypass them and leave them dependent on single pipelines from Russia. The countries would have preferred an alternative overland route. The 2004 interruption of gas supply to Belarus and the New Year's Day interruption of gas supply to the Ukraine, and the recent terrorist attacks on the pipelines to Georgia have increased concerns among Europeans that the supply of gas from Russia may not be reliable. Events such as equipment breakdowns and extreme weather can lead to supply interruptions. The planning of the multibillion dollar investments in gas field development and pipeline construction will depend on perceptions that (1) the price of the natural gas to customers will be competitive with other energy sources, and (2) that supplies will be reliable. There must be assurances that neither politically motivated shutdowns, equipment failures, extreme weather, or acts of terrorism or war will disrupt the transport of gas essential for heating and continued function of the economy in countries depending on natural gas imports. Alternative supplies energy are available to Europe through North Africa, the Middle East, and possibly from Central Asia, especially as new pipelines or LNG facilities are constructed.\n\n     What is needed for planning is methodology to deal with two issues: (1) a way of assessing the competition in price between gas from Russia and other energy materials for meeting the needs of European countries, looking forward for decades (2) a way to assess the uncertainties arising from weather, equipment failures, and political events to plan adequate redundancy in the energy supply system to that the probability of significant supply interruption can be made acceptably low. Multiple natural gas pipelines connecting gas fields to customers, underground gas storage located in customer countries, and provision to obtain and use other supplies under upset conditions may be needed to assure adequate supply reliability. The cost of these facilities needed for adequate supply reliability should be included in calculating what it will cost to provide gas from Russia to serve export markets in Europe. Therefore, the two issues must be linked.\n\nII.  Methodology Needed",
          "\n\n     How can these planning needs be met? In this paper the author shares experience from applications within the United States of risk and decision analysis, in the belief that such experience may be useful for those in Russia and in Europe responsible for planning GAZPROM's future and a reliable supply of energy to meet European energy needs. In the 1970s the author was involved in a number of energy planning studies in the United States, including the analysis of a major Presidential initiative to create a one million barrels-per-day synthetic fuel capability within ten years [3,4], and a comparison of the economic and social costs of coal and nuclear generation [5]. The author was also involved in a pioneering application of decision analysis to political events in the Persian Gulf area that might impact on the reliability of energy supply from that region [6]. The influence diagram methods developed in that project are described in a recently published pair of journal articles [7.8]. The author also chaired the review of the first set of reports to the US Congress on global climate change, for the Science Advisory Board of the US Environmental Protection Agency [9]. In October of 2004 the author substituted on short notice for his Stanford University colleague, Professor Stephen Schneider, in giving a presentation on global climate alteration in Stuttgart, at a meeting organized by the Minister of Transport and Energy of the State of Baden-W'rttemberg [10]. Especially in the roundtable discussion that followed the presentations, which included leaders of German industry and representatives from the German Bundestag, the author became persuaded that formal analysis of the kind done in the United States in the 1970s would be very helpful in Europe.\n\n     _Analytical Tools Area #1 ' Probabilistic Risk Analysis:_ A shortfall or failure in a complex system often can be described as a scenario, a set of events leading to this failure. Probabilistic models of such event sequences have a long history in statistics and reliability theory. Such approaches were developed in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and then widely applied in these industries and elsewhere. Decision analysis evolved out of statistical decision theory in the aftermath of World War II. In decision analysis, sequences are examined of decisions and uncertain events. A decision tree is often used as a visual display and as a computing device for computing the probability distributions corresponding to different decision alternatives, and then evaluating these to find the best decision. [11].\n\n     Influence diagrams [6,7,8] evolved from decision trees to deal with situations in the sequence of decisions and events has a complex structure of conditionality. For example, a series of ten to twenty uncertain events precedes the system failure of interest, and the probabilities assigned to one of these events may depend on some (say, 2 to 6), but not all of the preceding events and decisions in the sequence. With binary (two possible outcomes) events, a sequence of ten events leads to a thousand end points or scenarios, and 20 leads to a million. An illustration of such a tree showing all the possible outcomes becomes impractical except in a generic form. The influence diagram is a schematic form that shows by means of arrows connecting decisions and events (collectively referred to as 'nodes') the conditionality structure. Influence diagrams have achieved widespread use in decision analysis, operations research [12] reliability [13] and also in computer science applications, sometimes under the term, Bayesian nets. A recent application to protection against terrorism by the author's department chairman at Stanford and one of her students is found in [14]. Software packages for influence diagram computations are available from several sources. For the illustrative example below, the author has used [Decision Advisor](http://www.smartorg.com/decisionadvisor.html), a propriety software package for R&D management marketed by [SmartOrg](http://www.smartorg.com) of Menlo Park, California, USA.\n\nFailure of the natural gas supply system to meet gas demand might result from four types of events:\n\n- peak demands and/or reduced supply resulting from extreme weather\n\n- equipment failure for reasons other than extreme weather\n\n- terrorist attacks\n\n- deliberate interruption in supply by the leadership in the supplying country.\n\nAn influence diagram is shown in Figure 1.\n\n     The arrows show conditionality for dependence of the uncertain events on preceding events. For example, we assume that a failure of the system to meet peak demands as the result of extreme weather depends on whether the extreme weather occurs (and perhaps to what extent) and on the configuration of the pipeline and storage system. An analysis might consider a base case and several alternatives in which additional investment has been made to have storage facilities and one or more additional pipelines from the supplier country. For each system configuration and each of the weather outcomes, a probability is assigned to each of the cases for a supply shortfall. We show below in Figure 2 a decision tree representation: two outcomes for extreme weather (yes and no), three systems configurations (base and two alternatives) and two possibilities for shortfall (shortage and none).\n\n     Moving from left to right and then down the influence diagram in Fig 1, probabilities are assigned to 'terrorist attack,' conditional on which of these outcomes occurs and the system configuration alterative. 'Deliberate flow restriction' is shown conditioned only on 'supplier political evolution.' Once probabilities are assigned to all the possible outcomes for each event and decision, a composite probability can be computed for each possible path or scenario. Figure 3 shows the probability distribution computed for illustrative numbers in this highly simplified influence diagram.\n\n     The approach is capable of using a much more complex structure of decisions and uncertain events conditionally dependent on preceding decisions and events (nodes) in the influence diagram. For the other three terms, we have conditioned equipment failure only on the configuration decision, and we condition 'terrorist attack' on 'supplier political evolution.' 'Deliberate flow restriction' is also conditioned on what happens in 'supplier political evolution.' This node is intended to describe what might happen politically in eastern European countries during the next 5-15 years. A very simple characterization of three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive outcomes for one or more countries might be: continued steady progress in democracy, protracted civil unrest, and reversion to authoritarian imperialism. Probabilities may be assigned to each of these outcomes, based on the judgment of experts in the politics of the area. Disagreement among such experts can be expected. Which judgments are most important? Sensitivity analysis can help determine which judgments are most important in influencing the overall probability of supply interruption and its economic and social consequences.\n\n     Once the set of conditional probability assignments are complete and outcomes for 'unmet demand' resulting from the four sets of causes are described, then the software can compute probability distributions for each configuration, so that costs and risks of supply interruptions of different time periods and regional impact magnitudes can be compared. An illustrative cumulative distribution is shown below in Figure 3. It shows a moderate probability (about 7%) of a limited shortfall judged to be worth about\n' 1 billion, and a much smaller probability (0.7 %) of a much larger shortfall, valued at\n' 60 billion. Such a disaster would be comparable to the impacts the US has experienced from the Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005. A disaster of this magnitude might plausibly result from a major, extended interruption, perhaps from a series of successful terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or an extreme action, or series of actions to reduce supply from gas sources and deliberate shutdown of pipelines.\n\n     The structure shown in Figure 1 here is intended only as a highly simplistic description of the methodology, for those not familiar with influence diagrams and probabilistic risk analysis. Applications of probabilistic risk analysis to weather and equipment failure are widely carried out by gas and electric utilities. Application to the threat posed by terrorism and political decisions to interrupt supply are not widely practiced. It may be useful to carry out such an analysis as the basis for dialogue among the concerned parties. For example, some parties in Russia may assert that the threat of terrorist attack in Lithuania and other Baltic countries led to a preference for the Baltic undersea pipeline route over the cheaper overland route. Figure 4 and influence diagrams of similar complexity in [14] illustrate how complex sequences of events may be represented suing influence diagrams as a means of assessment expert judgment for probabilistic risk analysis.\n\n     _Analytical Tools Area #2: Energy Models for Long-range Planning:_ Planning the future of a complex energy system on a time scale of many decades is a daunting challenge. Dating back at least to period in the 1970s when the United States was considering large investments in new energy systems, such computer planning models are increasingly being used by businesses and government agencies.\n\n     Stanford University has since the 1970s had an activity called the Energy Modeling Forum, in which leaders in the field of energy modeling bring their models (often proprietary computer software, developed at considerable investment expense) and come together to analyze case exercises, from regional planning to global response in the context of global climate change. Reference [15] is a report on dealing with natural gas supply in North America. One of the models used in the exercise described in [15], the North American Gas Model (NARG), is a direct descendent of the SRI-Gulf model used for the synthetic fuel commercialization analysis described in [3] and [4]. In [15] this model was being used on behalf of the California Energy Commission; it has also been used for many leading US and international oil and gas companies. The lead modeler, [Dale Nesbitt](http://www.altosmgmt.com/dale.htm), worked with the author on the 1975 synthetic fuel analysis ([3] and [4]). The generalized equilibrium methodology involves an extension from mathematical programming to finding the fixed point solution x to an equation f(x) = x, where x is a vector of very high dimensionality describing flow quantities and prices of energy materials at different locations in a network connecting energy resources in the ground to energy end use demands, and at different time points from the beginning to the end of the planning horizon [16,17]. The NARG model and its European counterpart, the European Gas Model, are not unique to one vendor. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Rice University have developed similar models based on the generalized equilibrium approach. Other modeling and simulation approaches can be used to forecast how the competition may evolve between natural gas from Russia, natural gas from other sources, and competing fuels and technologies for meeting Europe's needs.\n\n     Understanding how the European energy system may evolve over a period from now to the middle of the twenty-first century can be greatly aided by the use of advanced energy modeling tools. Energy models are particularly useful for projecting changes as energy prices and the availability of energy technologies change over time. The models can also be used to analyze upset conditions, such as those that occurred in the US during the last half of 2005 because of hurricane damage.\n\nIII.  Combining Both Analytical Tool Areas: the 1975 Synthetic Fuels Analysis",
          "\n\n     The 1975 analysis [3,4] of the US decision on investing billions of dollars to create a million-barrel-per-day industry to make gas and liquid fuels from coal and oil shale showed that this investment was a poor idea. The program proposed in the President's State of the Union was first scaled down to a smaller program of one commercial scale plant of each technology, a total capacity of 1/3 of a million barrels per day. This smaller program was proposed by President Gerald Ford but voted down by the US Congress. Under the next President, Jimmy Carter, a small synthetic fuels program was established. The program failed badly, for reasons that were foreseen in the analysis: The increased prices of oil and other energy materials that occurred in the mid-1970s led to reduction in demand, and also to expansion of conventional oil and gas supplies, with the result that there was no market for high-cost synthetic fuel made from shale and coal. The Great Plains Coal Gasification plant was built, but it was not able to sell its gas product, because the price of gas was below the operating cost to produce gas from this plant. There was no return of profit to offset the high capital cost of the plant. The plant was therefore abandoned, with the loss of the capital cost of its construction at the expense of the US government.\n\n     The analytic tools used for the analysis ([3] and [4]) included the decision tree shown in Figure 5 describing important uncertainties and how future decisions to expand capacity would depend on the immediate decisions to be taken in the mid-1970s. Many thousands of scenarios were represented in the decision tree, and across this large number of scenarios (with some approximations via curve fitting) an energy model was used to assess how prices, technology choices, and energy quantities might evolve for that scenario.\n\n     A number of other analyses were carried out in the US in the late 1970s using multiple scenarios and energy models. A review of some of these analyses appears in [18]. The synthetic fuels analysis was one of the most elaborate, and it was tightly focused toward one specific government policy decision. It should be a useful example to Russian and European Union experts in analysis of specific alternatives, such as new pipelines and LNG transport facilities, for supplying reliable natural gas and other energy materials to Europe in the coming decades.\n\nIV. Needs for Future Planning and Decision Making",
          "\n\n     In planning Europe's energy future, the leadership in energy companies and governments need to work effectively together, and to overcome legacies of mistrust and misunderstanding that come from many historical events and from differences in institutions and cultures. Effective planning and decision making require not only the mastery of analytical methods for dealing with the complexity and uncertainty of energy markets and technological development, but also learning how effective governance can be achieved among a multiplicity of stakeholders ' national governments, the European Union and the G-8, energy companies, and concerned citizens in many countries. It is not just a technical problem - it is also an extreme social and political challenge! Several recent reports have suggested how decision analysis methods can support improvements in risk governance in order to improve the transparency and effectiveness of national and international dialogue [19, 20, 21].\n\n     In the Preface to the National Energy Strategy for Lithuania ([1], page 5), Dr. Jurgis Vilemas writes, 'Decision-making will hopefully, in the end, be based on economic reasoning, realistic demand forecasts and the latest achievements in development of energy generation technology.' This is an excellent place for planning to start, and the author looks forward to working with Dr. Vilemas and his colleagues on a study of how to meet the energy needs of the Baltic Region. This analysis will be broadened from a focus on purely economic reasoning to include the four types of risk issues that have been listed in this paper and illustrated in the simple influence diagram: extreme weather, equipment failure, terrorism and sabotage, and political interference in energy trade. The author hopes that the RIMS-2006 participants, the management of VNIIGAZ and GAZPROM, and the leadership of energy planning for Europe share this expanded view on what needs to be done to support good decision making for the energy future of Russia and Europe.\n\nReferences",
