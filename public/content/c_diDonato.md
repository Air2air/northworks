#### **Cheryl North Interviews Joyce DiDonato Prior to Her Recital at the Herbst Theater, November 16, 2009**

Material from the Classical Music Column for the November 13, 2009 Preview Section and Inside Bay Area website, Bay Area News Group, under the headline, "DiDonato dips into Latin repertoire to keep dazzle going."

By Cheryl North

Remember Dorothy's exclamation to her little dog Toto in the classic movie *The Wizard of Oz*? "Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore," she said as the two emerged from the tornado-transported farmhouse into the magical Technicolor of Oz.

Similarly, Kansas-born mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato must be having like thoughts each time she steps forth onto one famed international stage after another and into the glittering, also magical, world of grand opera.

She has ascended to superstardom with her thrilling trills, turns, and roulades in the coloratura roles of Rossini's operas. She earns equal praises for her transcendently sublime sallies through stately Handel operas.

Her only peer in such dauntingly difficult roles seems to be the Marilyn Horne of a couple of decades past. Both DiDonato and the legendary 75-year-old Horne are pleased with the comparison.

Local audiences will have a rare opportunity to experience the magnetic DiDonato's solo recital skills in a San Francisco Performances-sponsored concert Monday in San Francisco's Herbst Theatre. Accompanying her at the piano will be John Churchwell.

Her program will consist of a single selection each from a variety of Southern European composers, along with song sets by the Italian-Tunisian Francesco Santoliquido, the Spanish-Catalonian Fernando Obradors; Spanish composer Enrique Granados and a set of her favorite songs by Cuban Xavier Monsalvatge, a composer whose music she describes as "in the style of early 20th-century Italians like Puccini."

So, why is an Irish-American girl singing a uniquely Latin program?

"I feel a strain of Latin in my blood," the affably unaffected diva explained during a recent telephone interview. "I identify with the heat, rhythm, and passion of such music."

DiDonato, 40, is the sixth of seven children born into the Flaherty family of Prairie Village, Kansas. Her father was the local church choir director — and not unexpectedly, all seven children turned out to be musical.

"I grew up singing," she said. "One of my favorite things to do as a toddler was to sit off to the side during choir rehearsals and watch my father conduct. I joined his choir myself when I was in the sixth grade."

But rather surprisingly, she does not believe she has a natural singing voice.

"Starting out, my strongest quality was my stage presence "... I've always been attracted to acting and initially intended to teach high school vocal music and musical theater. My vocal skills came later, when I really began working on my technique," she said.

Now critics describe her glorious voice as "having the power to draw the listener to her," as being "round and plummy," "lean and insinuating," "bubbly and light" and a host of other superlatives. A New York Times critic acclaimed that "added to her lovely voice and precise coloratura were superb dramatic skills: she spoke volumes with a sly smile or an arched eyebrow."

She earned her first degree from Wichita State University in 1992 and went on to concentrate on vocal performance at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. In 1995, she was accepted into Santa Fe Opera's Young Artists Program — and she was named the company's "Outstanding Apprentice Artist." She was snatched up by the Houston Grand Opera to participate in its young artist program in 1996 and in 1997, by San Francisco Opera's Merola Program.

Since then, she has accumulated a heap of awards and critical accolades — and they just seem to keep coming. Among them are the Richard Tucker Award in 2002, the Beverly Sills Award in 2007 and most recently, one of the 2009 Opera News Awards. She has also just released an EMI/Virgin recording, "Colbran, the Muse: Opera Arias by Rossini," which is already on the Billboard chart.

But perhaps her latest claim to notoriety occurred during last summer's production of *The Barber of Seville*" at London's Covent Garden. "Go break a leg" is the traditional good luck admonition to give someone before he goes on stage to perform. DiDonato actually did just that — broke her leg, right in the middle of the performance. But, with the help of her gallant cast members and a cane, she carried on. For the rest of the run, she navigated about the set in a wheelchair and a stylish pink cast.

"How did you do it?" I asked.

"Well, I've always been a bit of a klutz, with weak ankles and rubber bands for ligaments. But, I'm also very Midwestern. If I have a job to do, I'll do it no matter what. Even though it hurt, my adrenaline kicked in and I simply did it," she said.

After Monday's San Francisco concert, she's off to Los Angeles Opera to reprise her inimitable Rosina in *The Barber of Seville*.
