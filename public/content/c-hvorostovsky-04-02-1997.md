If great opera composers of the past could have dealt with baritones like Dmitri Hvorostovsky, they wouldn't have given all the hero roles to tenors. The splendid Russian-born and trained Hvorostovsky joined with conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony for what might become the definitive performance of Modest Mussorgsky's 'Songs and Dances of Death' Wednesday at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.

The entire program - Toru Takemitsu's "Requiem for Strings,'' and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, "Pathetique,'' in addition to the Mussorgsky songs - was a musical essay on life's somber closing moments. The serious, sober mood of the evening seemed appropriate, and perhaps even healing, as conductor, musicians, and public once again assemble, following the recent
strike, to rekindle their relationship.

The concert's most riveting moments were when Hvorostovsky was in command. Although only in his early 30s, he has the vocal equivalent of a Stradivarius in residence in his throat and barrel chest. This gives his voice a warm luminosity, which extends throughout his entire vocal
register. When coupled with his tremendous breath control, this golden sheen is maintained through a broad range of dynamics as well.

During Wednesday's concert, he projected an incredibly pure, focused pianissimo, even in his highest register, as well as belting out ringing crescendos of untarnished beauty. He handled the Mussorgsky songs' low notes like a bass baritone and managed the clarity and ring of a tenor through the last song's gruelingly high tessitura.

Hvorostovsky's keen sense of drama and innate musicality added to the excitement produced by his voice. He sang 'Lullaby,' the first of the Mussorgsky songs, with a dynamic range akin to Schubert's 'Erlkonig.' He became three distinct personas within the poignant mini-drama ' by turns, the soberly direct narrator; the agitated, heartbroken mother; and, as Death itself, ominously 'comforting' while singing to the mother that he can ease the child's pain and silence his crying - forever. In the second song, 'Serenade,' Hvorostovsky became a deceptive, vampire-like Death as he assumed the role of a wooing knight to a young invalid woman. The Russian words, translated into English, 'But at midnight, to answer her yearning, Death sings his soft serenade' and the eventual 'Listen to the sweet nothings I murmur... Be still, you are
mine!' could send shudders down the stiffest spine.

There was an element of cynicism in 'Trepak', the third song, as Hvorostovsky sang of Death encountering an old drunken peasant in the snowy winter woods. The cycle's most intense drama was unleashed in song 4, 'Commander-in-Chief,' when Death presides over a battle and proclaims 'I am triumphant now! Victor and vanquished alike I subdue.' Hvorostovsky's
voice pierced like a shining blade through the dense orchestral textures simulating a barrage of artillery.

Although Mussorgsky completed the songs in early Summer, 1877, it was Dmitri Shostakovich who gave them their rich orchestration in 1962. The Symphony musicians played well throughout the work and outstandingly in several instances. Some of these occurred during the 'Serenade' when the tympani ticked away life's waning moments like a doomsday clock and the
oboe provided a plaintive counterpoint to Death's passion. Other instances of fine musicianship happened when a choir of brass assembled to intone chorale-like passages and when the lower strings achieved an almost uncanny resonance as they accompanied Death's approach to the battlefield in the final song.

MTT's interpretation of Tchaikovsky's 'Pathetique' Symphony was tightly controlled, yet weighty. Conductor and orchestra achieved a sense of epic sweep that endured through the opening bassoon lament, the second movement's offbeat waltz, the mad march of the third, and on to the utter desolation of its closing notes. The Tchaikovsky panorama also featured a number of outstanding solos. There were fine solos from the principal cello, violin, and clarinet, and a splendid rise-and-shine exhilaration from the brass as the first movement swept to its close. The strings were brilliantly unified as they played the wonderful swooshes of ascending pitches in the last movement countering the descending line played with sepulchral sobriety by the horns. At the onset, the strings sounded a bit thin and the French horns were less than distinguished. But as the work progressed, things came together to create broad sweeping phrases that crested like waves of the sea before ebbing away into a simmering calm.

The Takemitsu Requiem made for a meaningful, beautiful beginning to the concert. The late Japanese composer's synthesis of Oriental and Occidental musical elements was very much in evidence as MTT and the orchestra achieved an almost impressionistic evanescence throughout the work's single movement. Although the Takemitsu work seemed atonal in 1957,
in the 1990s, it rests harmoniously.
