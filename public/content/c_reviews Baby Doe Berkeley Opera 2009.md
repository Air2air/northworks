Hard times, whether economic, social, or political, can often serve as stimulus to human creativity &#8212; &#8220;necessity is the mother of invention&#8221; and that sort of thing. Berkeley Opera&#8217;s current production, Douglas Moore&#8217;s <i>The Ballad of Baby Doe</i>, set to a libretto  by John Latouche, offers a vivid case in point.</p>

<p></p>Composer Moore, known for his tonally melodic and engagingly rhythmic writing in what has been labeled &#8220;typical American folk style,&#8221; based his opera on a true story that took place in rip-roaring mid-19th century Colorado during the heyday of silver mining.  It&#8217;s a rags-to-riches-to-ruin tale of Vermont-born Horace Tabor, who, in midlife, divorces his cold-fish wife Augusta after falling deeply in love with a warm, beautiful, but decades-younger woman, a divorcee named Elizabeth &#8220;Baby&#8221; Doe.</p>

<p></p>Berkeley Opera&#8217;s big problem, according to it artistic director Jonathan Khuner, is the depressed economy.  &#8220;Our reality-mandated 40 percent cut in the budget has required that the opera take place on a spare stage with just one table and five chairs,&#8221; he says. It also forced Khuner to assume the duties of stage director in addition to conducting the show.</p>

<p></p>But, no need to worry.  What Berkeley Opera may lack in money, it more than made up for with a heaping helping of ingenuity.</p><p></p>The most impressive, jaw-dropping examples of ingenuity were the breath-taking scenic projections created by Jeremy Knight, abetted by Alexander Kort&#8217;s lighting wizardry.  I marveled at the Knight-Kort set-up: one huge rectangular screen forming the wall at the left side of the stage; four smaller rectangles aligned to suggest a receding perspective of windows veering off on the back of the stage. A large oval-shaped screen was set up on the right front of the stage to alternately accommodate a series of interiors, such as a saloon wall with a &#8220;naughty&#8221; Victorian painting of Leda and the Swan hanging above the projected rack of bar bottles; a prim parlor wall hung with stripped wallpaper and family portraits; a festively decorated room in Washington, D.C.&#8217;s  Willard Hotel; or  a forest of  languid-looking willow trees lit by moonlight.</p><p></p>Who really needs a stage full of lumbering sets and heavy, sometimes awkwardly painted backdrops, when you can have such things as a realistic illusion of boom-town Denver backed by its magnificent ring of sky-high mountains via the ingenious use of artfully lighted scenic projections? High tech to the rescue!</p><p></p>But beyond the opera&#8217;s romantic love story aspect, the tale deals with the boom to bust former times when the idealistic, thoroughly democratic-minded Midwestern candidate William Jennings Bryan ran unsuccessfully for the presidency against William McKinley, who had the backing of powerful East Coast banks and financial institutions.</p><p></p>McKinley&#8217;s win, a tragedy for the silver rich Tabors, enabled the country&#8217;s transfer  from a dual silver and gold standard for the American dollar to gold alone.  Overnight, the Tabors lost their fortune as well as the friends and status it had attracted.</p><p></p>The role of Horace Tabor, was sung with appropriate gusto by rakishly handsome baritone, Torlef Borsting, who moved convincingly from rowdy full-voice banter at the saloon with his pals to sotto voce crooning to Baby Doe. His love song to her, &#8220;Warm as the Autumn Night&#8221; was especially beautiful.</p><p></p>Petite, but voluptuous soprano Jillian Khuner, a consummate singing actress, created an endearing Baby Doe. Her ultra high notes, sung pitch-pure at pianissimo levels during her &#8220;Willow Song,&#8221; seemed capable of melting an iceberg or quenching a fire. While her high range soared, her midrange initially suffered from excessive vibrato.</p><p></p>Tall, reed-slim mezzo-soprano Lisa Houston, in her severely cut black gowns, was a  convincing Augusta, as her character teetered on the edge of  forgiveness, before finally, angrily, falling into an abyss of bitter vengeance.</p><p></p>In addition to a small, skilled chorus and orchestra, there were also two outstanding quartets of singers: Alexander Taite, Kenny Louis, Michael Beetham and Wayne Wong performing with exceptional dramatic and musical polish as Tabor&#8217;s long-time cronies, and a finely blended group of ladies &#8212; Elizabeth Wells, Angela Hayes, Elizabeth Gentner, and Cary Ann Rosko &#8212; who seemed to be having great fun acting out the righteous indignation of Augusta&#8217;s prim lady friends.</p><p></p>
