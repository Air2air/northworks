<h4>Sustainable Fuel Cycle Task Force</h4>
Dr. North serves as a member of the Science Panel of this group, which was established following the Obama Administration's actions to curtail further activity on the proposed repository for high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Information on the Task Force and its Science Panel has been available on its website (sustainablefuelcyclesciencepanel.org, which should be online again soon). <p></p>

The Science Panel has sent letters, most recently to Secretary of Energy Perry <a href="science panel ltr to secretary perry- 17-11-14.pdf">(letter dated November 14, 2017)</a>, and previously to him as the nominee for Secretary, <a href="science panel ltr to governor perry-17-01-23 final.pdf">(letter dated January 23, 2017)</a>  recommending that he make one of his highest priorities the restarting of the Yucca Mountain licensing process. (The links above are to these letters as pdf files.)<br /> 

<h4>Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future</h4>
<!A HREF="http://energycommerce.house.gov/hearing/recommendations-blue-ribbon-commission-america%E2%80%99s-nuclear-future">Warner North testified before the House Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, Feb 1, 2012 on the Blue Ribbon Commission's Final Report to the Secretary of Energy.</a> A perspective article based on this testimony was published in <i>Risk Analysis</i> January 2013: "Can Sisyphus Succeed? Getting U.S. High-Level Nuclear Waste into a Geological Repository," <b>Risk Analysis 33</b>(1):2-14, 2013.<br /><p></p>
