How do you portray a god?</p>
<p></p>That was a question a fan recently asked handsome, linebacker-built baritone Mark Delavan, who will portray Wotan, Nordic king of the gods, in San Francisco Opera's upcoming production of Richard Wagner's <i>Die Walk&#252;re.</i>"</p>
<p></p>"You don't!" said Delavan."What you do is play up the god's human-like qualities," he added. </p>
<p></p>Delavan's Wotan &mdash; a character he first stepped into when S.F. Opera began its so-called "American" take on the Wagner <i>Ring</i> Cycle with a production of <i>Das Rheingold</i> in 2008 &mdash; "is just as messed up as we ordinary people are."</p>
<p></p>During a recent phone chat, amiable, bronze-voiced Delavan explained he portrays Wotan as passionate, emotional, quick to anger when disobeyed, incredibly duplicitous and greedy &mdash; "a little like one of the big financial moguls during the first part of the last century in the United States."</p>
<p></p>"He's also terrifically henpecked by his wife, the goddess Fricka, and deeply loves and trusts his favorite daughter, the Valkyrie Br&#252;nnhilde," he continued. (The Valkyries were the flying godlike maidens resulting from Wotan's previous coupling with the Earth goddess Erda.) </p>
<p></p>Delavan, who also has sung the title role in Wagner's <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> throughout the world, quips that "I'm just a rookie Wotan," but he does seem to have found his niche.</p>
<p></p>A deeply committed family man, he revealed that he fights tears when the point in the opera comes for Wotan to kill his son, Sigmund.</p>
<p></p>"It's a moment when I can't help but think how I feel about my own four sons, he said. "I'm sure it shows up in my singing."</p>
<p></p>Another commonality shared by Wotan and Delavan is that both carve wood and work with metal. Wotan is supposed to have crafted his own spear, Delavan explained.</p>
<p></p>"I love to carve wood, especially knife, dirk and dagger handles, as well as to etch the metal of the blades. I even carved my own spear for <i>Die Walk&#252re</i>'s premiere in Washington, D.C. But the director/designer, Francesca Zambello, replaced the staff part with something more raw and rough-hewn."</p>
<p></p>His passion for carving and design almost rivals his love for opera. He even has a website displaying his artistic creations, <a href='http://www.delavanedge.com'>www.delavanedge.com</a>. </p>
<p></p>"But, I generally carve for relaxation and satisfaction, sometimes even during rehearsal breaks," he said. "A lot of pieces of wood have saved my sanity!"</p>
<p></p>According to Delavan, Wagner's ingenious use of the leitmotif technique in his <i>Ring</i> operas has contributed to their popularity. (A leitmotif is a specific musical theme played throughout the opera to signify a particular idea, emotion, or person.) </p>
<p></p>"Somehow, a leitmotif can penetrate your brain, even if you don't know music that well. That's one reason why there are so many 'Ringheads' around," he said, adding that one middle-aged fan told him after a recent performance that it was his 85th <i>Ring</i>.</p>
<p></p>As an example, Delavan singled out the Valhalla theme, especially as it is played by a choir of brass instruments, as his choice for the most noble, profound music in Wagner's operas. When I asked him if he could remind me of that particular theme, he said, "Just a minute &mdash; I'll try to find my horn voice."</p>
<p></p>Then, right over the phone, he proceeded to replicate the timbre of a French horn to illustrate the soaring theme. I almost cried.</p>
<p></p>I suppose I would have, had soprano Nina Stemme, the production's Br&#252;nnhilde, not appeared at the door for our scheduled interview.</p>
<p></p>Petite, fit and dark-haired, Swedish-born Stemme can dazzle at first sight with her incandescent blue eyes. But the alto-pitched warmth of her speaking voice put me completely at ease.</p>
<p></p>Although she is seasoned in many roles, the San Francisco performance represents her debut as Br&#252;nnhilde. According to a talk conductor Donald Runnicles gave at the Opera House later that evening, Stemme is on the fast track to becoming one of the greatest Br&#252;nnhildes ever.</p>
<p></p>When I asked her how she perceives the character, she replied, "Br&#252;nnhilde is the son Wotan never got. He trusts her to carry out his will and together, they create a sort of team."</p>
<p></p>She elaborated that Wotan, as ruler of the gods, is expected to follow the rules. Br&#252;nnhilde, on the other hand, is driven by a will of her own and strong emotions. In "Walk&#252;re," she is a very undeveloped persona, a teenager. By the end of the <i>Ring</i>," in <i>G&#246;tterd&#228;mmerung</i>, the mature Br&#252;nnhilde becomes civilization's savior by casting the Rhine gold back into the river from which it was wrongly stolen.</p>
<p></p>When I asked her if she always wanted to be a singer, she replied that although she had played violin, viola and piano and sang in school choirs as a child, she actually had planned to become an engineer or an economist. After a year as an exchange student in a Virginia high school, she was converted to music. When she returned to Sweden, she had to go through three auditions at a college where she could study opera before she was finally admitted.</p>
<p></p>Now she is in demand in the greatest opera houses of the world. However, despite her fame and acclaim, she says, "I devote most of my non-singing time to my family -- my stage-designer husband, two daughters and a son."  The smile accompanying these words told me she means it.</p>
