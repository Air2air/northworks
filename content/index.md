### New from Cheryl North

#### Berkeley Symphony 2017

Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13, *Babi Yar*, powerfully sets the text by Yevgeni Yevtushenko commemorating the massacre of Jews at Babi Yar during World War II. It employs a solo bass voice and male chorus plus symphony orchestra. Here is Cheryl North's [column](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/01/berkeley-symphony-to-perform-shostakovichs-riveting-babi-yar-symphony/) previewing the Berkeley Symphony's May 4 performance.
