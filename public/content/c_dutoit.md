     Not all of the world's greatest musicians started out on their performing paths as three-year-olds toddling up to the family piano and proceeding to dazzle their amazed parents with a display of precocious musical ability.  The great Swiss-born conductor, Charles Dutoit, for example, was far more interested in math and science than music during his early youth.<p></p>  
      "In fact, my interest in music started quite late - not until age 12," he revealed during an interview at San Francisco's Huntington Hotel last week.<p></p>  
     The tall, elegant conductor, looking youthfully fit and at least a decade younger than his admitted age of 70,  has been in the Bay Area for a couple of weeks to conduct the San Francisco Symphony.  Last week, he presided over concerts of works by Ravel, Strauss, and Beethoven.  This week, he is in the midst of a series of four performances of Hector Berlioz' <i>The Damnation of Faust</i>, during which the orchestra is joined by the  San Francisco Symphony Chorus, the Pacific Boychoir, the San Francisco Girls' Chorus, and soloists Ruxandra Donose as Marguerite, Gregory Kunde as Faust, Willard White as Mephistopheles, and Christopher Feigum, as Brander.  <p></p>
      Reminiscing about his early years, Dutoit said, "There was a band at my school --and many of my friends were members.  I wanted to join too, but my father thought that the brass instrument I wanted to play would be too loud. He suggested that I try a violin instead.  So, I did.  And then music took over -- even though my father was not enthusiastic.  He would rather that I studied architecture or engineering." <p></p>  
     Another source of the young Dutoit's musical inspiration was the time he spend ushering at the cathedral, where he could often bask in the beauty of the sounds from the choir, organ, and other musicians. His music study thenceforth turned very serious and he was schooled at the Lausanne Conservatory where he studied other instruments as well as conducting from Charles Munch. During these early years, Dutoit performed and toured across Europe and South America from the orchestra side of the podium as a violist.<p></p>
      But, by the time he was 21, he had earned the first prize in conducting from the conservatory.  His first professional conducting experience followed shortly thereafter when he led the Lausanne orchestra in a performance of Haydn's <i>Symphony No. 103</i> and Ravel's <i>Piano Concerto in G Major</i>, with a young Martha Argerich as soloist. <p></p>
      "I found that I loved conducting - not so much the macho maestro aspects of it, as for the very richness and depth of it all," he said, before breaking a broad smile and adding that in January of 2009, 50 years after this original Lausanne debut, he will conduct the very same program, in the same place, with the same orchestra, with Argerich once again as piano soloist. (He eventually married and later divorced Argerich, but the two nonetheless maintain a fruitful artistic relationship).<p></p>
      He subsequently became a guest conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, and in 1967, was named conductor of the Bern Symphony Orchestra.  In 1977 he followed the paths of Otto Klemperer and Zubin Mehta to  become the Artistic Director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. He stayed for 25 years.<p></p>
       In recent decades, Dutoit has become one of the world's preeminent conductors. Besides winning many national and international awards, he has guest-conducted most of the world's major orchestras. Literally scores of recordings are also among his credits, many of which have won Grammy or other awards. He has served as either music director or principal conductor of such great orchestras as the Orchestre National de France, Tokyo's NHK Symphony Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. <p></p> 
      His most recent honor was announced just last week, when he was named the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, beginning with the 2009-2010 season. <p></p>
     Among Dutoit's favorite memories are his early experiences with the great Herbert von Karajan.  Back in 1964, when von Karajan was preparing to release his own 33-1/3 recording of  Stravinsky's <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, a work purportedly "not one of his favorites," he was told about the young Dutoit's concurrent stint conducting the piece in Bern. The elder Maestro is said to have remarked to Mattoni, his secretary, "I would like to meet this guy." <p></p>
     Ten days later, Dutoit received a call from the Vienna State Opera to conduct Manuel de Falla's opera, <i>The Three-Cornered Hat.</i>  Von Karajan, who was the Vienna company's artistic director, was, of course, in the audience.<p></p>
      Another von Karajan encounter that brought a gleeful smile to Dutoit's face, was when he was invited to ride with the Maestro in his brand new, state-of-the-art 300 SL Mercedes from Milan to Brescia.  At Brescia, von Karajan's destination, Mattoni, assumed transportation duties and Dutoit and he continued on to Venice in what Dutoit jovially described as Mattoni's  "rather odd looking lemon yellow Studebaker."<p></p>
     To my question about why so many of his recordings were concentrated in either French or Russian schools of music, Dutoit quickly retorted, "Doesn't mean a thing. I conduct all kinds of music. What really happened is that back in the early 1980s, my first CD recording, Ravel's <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, was only the fourth commercial CD release in history.  At that time, there were only about 12 CDs on the shelves and these were by von Karajan and Solti in the German masterworks and Pavarotti in opera. There was a definite niche available for French and Russian music.  Our <i>Daphnis</i> became successful - and success demands more of the same." <p></p>
         One of Maestro Dutoit's most recent enthusiasms is a music training school, the Canton International Summer Music Academy, he has founded in Southeast Asia for local music students ranging in age from 16 through 25.  <p></p>
     "These students are in an area that really needs help," he said.  "For three weeks each summer, we provide them with at least 15 tutors, all members of the London, Chicago and other great orchestras of the world."  <p></p> 
       In response to questions about Berlioz' <i>The Damnation of Faust</i>, the work Dutoit is conducting this week, he explained that, although the work was suggested by Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, the interpretation is uniquely Berlioz' own. <p></p>
     "Berlioz was among the first to read its initial French translation in 1824 when he was only 21. When he eventually began composing his own version, being an intense Romantic, he felt strongly that Faust should be damned (Goethe's original suggests Faust's ultimate redemption) and Marguerite alone, redeemed. His orchestration and interpretation of the major characters is lush and Romantic, like the music and literature of his own era. Goethe, more of a Classicist, was from the generation that preceded him." <p></p>
