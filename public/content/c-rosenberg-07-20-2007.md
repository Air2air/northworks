title: Rosenberg Brings S.F. Flavor to Berlin Philharmonic

A few weeks ago I visited Berlin, the edgy, energetic capitol of Germany. Berlin, having survived (sometimes barely) a tumultuous history beginning sometime in the 13th century in a niche between the Havel and the Spree Rivers in north-central Germany, has evolved into a rather unsettlingly angular city. Assertive, sometimes shocking skyscrapers cut into its skies, while thousands of giant dark green Linden trees arrayed in long rows tend to calm its labyrinthine streets.

Ruins of old church towers and cathedrals pose peacefully alongside recent restorations as well as the eye-popping new buildings. People with features and physiques representing gene pools from Nordic, Slavic, Eastern, and Central European countries mingle comfortably with its tall, blond Germanic archetypes in the shops and cafes. Even the genial Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit (pronounced Voverite), has been quoted as saying that "Berlin is the largest Turkish city outside of Turkey."

But there's also a distinctly American, even Bay Area, presence now flowing like a spring of fresh water through the city. Los Angeles-born and Francisco-seasoned Pamela Rosenberg is in residence.

Rosenberg, who finished five lively, sometimes controversial, years as San Francisco Opera's General Director in 2005, is now the "Intendantin" (CEO) of Berlin's pride and joy, its legendary Philharmonic Orchestra. As such, she serves alongside its Conductor-in-Chief, Sir Simon Rattle, another scion of English-speaking lands with Bay Area connections.

Since I was alone, and a bit jangled by Berlin's highly complex Teutonic transportation system, she generously sent her orchestra-supplied driver to fetch me for our interview. We drove to her large airy apartment, located in a peaceful, park-like area of the city.

She ushered me into her sitting room, where we were soon joined by the early arrival of her next appointment, the jovial Speight Jenkins, General Manager of the Seattle Opera.

"Have you noticed, Pamela doesn't have any dark circles under her eyes anymore?" Jenkins quipped as he settled comfortably into a plush chair.

Indeed, she looked hale, slim, and rested, and brought us big glasses of ice water to help compensate for Berlin's hot, humid weather before telling us about her recent jaunt, along with a number of Bay Area friends, to Amsterdam to attend the European premiere of  Dr. Atomic  by Berkeley's John Adams.

The opera, a commission from the San Francisco Opera at the instigation of Rosenberg, had its world premiere in San Francisco on Oct. 1, 2005.

"There were 10 performances of the opera during the Holland Festival, and since Sellars and Adams had made huge changes in the second act, the whole thing was much better and tighter than the original. The audience loved it," she said, adding rather proudly that it is also scheduled to be performed by the Chicago Opera in December and at the Met several times in 2008.

Then, her startlingly blue eyes seemed to take on extra glints of light as she began to illuminate the plans she and Maestro Rattle had laid for the Philharmonic's upcoming season.

"We'll celebrate the orchestra's 125th Anniversary during 2007-2008," she said. "Our official theme will deal with the Philharmonic during the Nazi Period. Back in 1933-1935, there were only four Jewish players left in the orchestra - the concertmaster and three other first-chair musicians. With the help of Maestro Wilhelm Furtwangler, they were protected and enabled to flee Germany."

"This Jubilee Year is an appropriate time to tackle this issue," she said. "We've commissioned a special book by Mischa Aster dealing with the orchestra during the Nazi period, as well as a documentary film, and an important exhibition. These will be released during our November Festival.

Rosenberg noted that among those interred in the Theresianstadt concentration camp were such promising composers and musicians as Walter Braunfels, Pavel Haas, and what she described as "a whole generation of Europe's great musicians."

Rosenberg and Rattle are united in sharing goals for upcoming orchestral presentations that will add to the orchestra's efforts to "create connections between historical epochs, build bridges between varying cultures, and to connect historical retrospectives to the recollection of personal destinies."

Another example of this latter goal will be a repeat performance for the season opening on August 25 of Beethoven's  Leonore Overture  - the very work which Franz Wuellner conducted in the old Berlin Philharmonie Hall to open the orchestra's first concert on Oct. 23, 1882. But this time around, the old masterwork will be played along with a new work by contemporary composer Magnus Linberg.

Other such connections of different musical epochs will include juxtapositions of turn-of-the-20th-century works by Gustav Mahler with turn-of-the-21st-century pieces by the Finnish Linberg and the British contemporary composer Thomas Ades, as well as a world premiere of a piece by Christian Jost based Joseph Conrad's novel,  Heart of Darkness , juxtaposed with British Deryck Cooke's performing version of Mahler's unfinished  10th Symphony .

Berlin's coming season will also highlight ethnic connections and contrasts with several programs under the title "Alla turca: a Cultural Dialogue." These will bring Turkish music from the time of the 18th century's Suleman the Great together with music concurrently composed under Frederick the Great in Central Europe.

Other Bay Area connections will be made when Maestros Donald Runnicles and Nicola Luisotti, past and future music directors respectively, of the SF Opera, conduct the Berlin Philharmonic next season.

All of the above invoked a bit of d'j' vu taking me back to Rosenberg's first press conference as the new General Director of the San Francisco Opera in January of 2001. This was when she announced plans for her "Animating Opera" program, which she described as being designed to "enable our audiences to see interconnections between life and art" and to show that the musical arts have "the potential to make people think and feel more deeply about the human condition."

But, with her two sons, a daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren living nearby in Germany, Rosenberg is happy to remain in Berlin to connect her SFO music-life mission with the Berlin Philharmonic. Most Berliners consider it a great fit.
