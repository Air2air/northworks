### **Cheryl North Interviews Valery Gergiev prior to his performances
at Zellerbach Hall conducting all six of Tchaikovsky's symphonies**

*Material from the Classical Music Column for October 7, 2011 published on the websites and newspapers of the Bay Area News Group, under the headlines, "Passion for his fellow Russian renders Gergiev the Tchaikovsky Ambassador."*

A rare treat is coming up for Bay Area music lovers this month: Valery Gergiev, one of the world's most charismatic orchestral conductors in an era brimming with charismatic conductors, is scheduled to lead Russia's storied Mariinsky Orchestra through all six of Peter Illyich Tchaikovsky's beloved symphonies during a three-day residency next weekend at Zellerbach Hall on the UC Berkeley campus.

Symphony No, 1, subtitled *Winter Daydreams*, and No. 6, the *Pathetique*, will be performed at 8 p.m. Oct. 14; No. 2, *Little Russian*," and the dynamic No. 5, at 8 p.m. Oct. 15; and No. 3, the *Polish*, and No. 4 will complete the series at 3 p.m. Oct. 16.

A charmingly congenial Maestro Gergiev expressed a few cogent thoughts, in fluent English, on Tchaikovsky's music during a recent telephone conversation from London. While conceding that many listeners today underestimate Tchaikovsky's music or consider it to be a bit oversentimental and/or bombastic, Gergiev defends his 19th-century countryman fervently.

#### A refined composer

"Very often his music is not phrased properly, and the beauty of the orchestration not emphasized enough. Really, he is a very refined composer. While his music can be very passionate, it is never loud for loud's sake. It is full of beauty, even though often theatrical and balletlike," he said.

Gergiev was born in Moscow to Ossetian parents in 1953. He grew up in Vladikavkaz, a city in North Ossetia. When he was 8 years old, he started on piano lessons.

A few years later, his teacher asked him if he might like to try conducting. "It didn't mean very much to me then -- I didn't even know what an orchestra sounded like at that time," Gergiev explained. "It was after I started playing some of Beethoven's variations and sonatas when I was on the border of 12 or 13, that I started thinking about orchestras and of becoming a conductor."

That was about the time his piano teacher introduced him to conductor Anatoly Briskin, who then gave him conducting lessons. However, the young boy was much more interested in playing soccer than conducting. It was only after his father, an officer in the Red Army, suddenly died of a stroke when Gergiev was 14 that he turned to more serious things.

In a 2009 New York Times interview, Gergiev revealed that the day his father died was, up to that time, "the single saddest day of my life." He started spending more time alone, playing the piano as his life took on a much more serious tone.

Briskin, sensing the lad's inherent conducting ability and musical understanding, guided him to Leningrad to study with the brilliant conducting teacher Ilya Musin. Gergiev enrolled in Leningrad Conservatory at an especially propitious time.

"This was when I was 19 or 20," he said. "It helped me a lot, that, when I was studying there, Shostakovich was still alive, and most of my teachers, who were between 70 and 75 years old, knew him. Many had also known Prokofiev. They were directly connected to the events that had been happening 50 years before."

Still in his student days, Gergiev became so proficient in conducting that he won the 1977 Herbert von Karajan Conducting Prize. When Soviet authorities would not permit him to go to Berlin to work with Karajan, he took a post as an assistant conductor of the Kirov Opera, then under the leadership of Yuri Temirkanov in Leningrad. He made his own conducting debut the next year in Sergei Prokofiev's opera, *War and Peace*. He would later become a great champion of the music of Prokofiev.

"To this day," he noted, "I still conduct some Prokofiev piece at least once a month somewhere in the world."

By the time he was 35, Gergiev was named director of the Kirov Opera, and since 1996, he has been both artistic and general director of the Mariinsky Theatre. He has built the organization to support more than 2,000 employees and propelled it into one of the world's greatest musical institutions, providing programs of opera, ballet and orchestral music. His sister, Larissa Gergiev, and his younger sister's husband both work with the organization as well.

#### Man of many hats

This Russian dynamo also oversees music festivals in many countries, serves as principal conductor of the London Symphony and principal guest conductor of the Metropolitan Opera and guest conducts orchestras all over the world. Obviously a genius at juggling a whirlwind schedule, he also manages to spend quality time with his wife, Natalia Dzebisova, an Ossetian he met as a boy in music school, and their three children. In his spare time, he loves to indulge in old-fashioned Russian saunas, vacation close to a lake and watch sports events (especially tennis and soccer). He considers many athletes -- especially Michael Jordan and members of the Barcelona Soccer Club -- to be "true artists."
