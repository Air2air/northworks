# INTELLIGENT TAGGING STRATEGY FOR NORTHWORKS

## Executive Summary

The current tagging system has significant quality issues affecting content discoverability and user experience. This document outlines a comprehensive AI-powered approach to generate meaningful, consistent, and valuable tags across all content types.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified
1. **Generic Tags**: Many tags are too vague ("Aria", "Opera", "Symphony")
2. **Inconsistent Naming**: "Mozart" vs "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"
3. **Irrelevant Tags**: Tags not found in content
4. **Missing Key Entities**: Interviewee names, specific works, venues often missing
5. **Poor Quality Control**: No validation of tag usefulness

### Statistics
- 119 total content files
- 93.3% have existing tags
- Average 8.6 tags per file (many low quality)
- 27.7% of files have "Poor" quality tags
- 50.4% have "Good" quality tags

## Proposed Solution: Smart Tag Generation System

### 1. Content Type-Specific Analysis

#### Interviews
- **Primary Tag**: Always include interviewee name
- **Musical Context**: Venues, composers, works discussed
- **Performance Context**: Debut, farewell, special occasions
- **Quality Focus**: People > Works > Venues > Instruments

#### Reviews  
- **Performance Details**: Specific works reviewed
- **Venue Information**: Where performance took place
- **Artists/Performers**: Featured soloists, conductors
- **Event Context**: Opening night, gala, special events

#### Articles
- **Subject Matter**: Topics analyzed or discussed
- **Musical Works**: Compositions featured
- **Cultural Context**: Festivals, anniversaries, tributes
- **Analysis Type**: Critical discussion, historical context

#### Professional Content (Warner)
- **Expertise Areas**: Specific methodologies (not generic "Risk")
- **Organizations**: Full institutional names
- **Technical Methods**: Precise terminology
- **Subject Domains**: Specific policy areas

### 2. Tag Quality Standards

#### High-Quality Tags Must:
- Be **specific** rather than generic
- Use **proper names** and **full titles**
- **Appear in content** (verified)
- Follow **consistent naming** conventions
- Be **searchable** and **discoverable**
- Have **semantic meaning** for users

#### Examples of Good vs Bad Tags:

| Bad Tag | Good Tag | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "Opera" | "Don Giovanni" | Specific work vs generic genre |
| "Mozart" | "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart" | Full name consistency |
| "Conductor" | "Valery Gergiev" | Person name vs role |
| "Risk" | "Probabilistic Risk Assessment" | Specific methodology |
| "Symphony" | "Davies Symphony Hall" | Specific venue |

### 3. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Immediate)
- Remove tags not found in content
- Fix obvious quality issues
- Standardize composer names
- Add missing interviewee names

#### Phase 2: Smart Enhancement (1-2 weeks)
- Run AI analysis on all files
- Add high-value missing tags
- Implement quality scoring
- Create tag validation rules

#### Phase 3: Ongoing Maintenance (Continuous)
- Validate new content tags
- Monitor tag usage and effectiveness
- Refine algorithms based on search patterns
- User feedback integration

### 4. Tag Categories and Examples

#### Musical Entities
```
Composers: "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "Ludwig van Beethoven"
Works: "Don Giovanni", "Ring Cycle", "War Requiem"
Venues: "San Francisco Opera", "Carnegie Hall"
Instruments: "Piano", "Soprano", "Violin"
```

#### People
```
Interviewees: "Kurt Masur", "Susan Graham", "Iréne Theorin"
Performers: "Valery Gergiev", "Lang Lang"
Historical: "Birgit Nilsson", "Leonard Bernstein"
```

#### Professional/Technical
```
Methods: "Monte Carlo Simulation", "Decision Analysis"
Organizations: "Environmental Protection Agency", "Stanford University"
Domains: "Nuclear Safety", "Climate Change Policy"
```

#### Performance Context
```
Events: "Opening Night", "Debut Performance", "Farewell Concert"
Types: "Gala Performance", "Master Class", "World Premiere"
```

### 5. Quality Metrics

#### Scoring System
- **+2 points**: Specific entity (person, work, venue)
- **+1 point**: Present in content, properly capitalized
- **0 points**: Generic but acceptable
- **-1 point**: Poor quality (generic, misspelled)
- **-3 points**: Not found in content

#### Target Quality Levels
- **Good**: Score > 0, specific entities, content-verified
- **Fair**: Score 0 to -5, some issues but usable  
- **Poor**: Score < -5, major problems requiring fixes
