The Oakland East Bay Symphony opened its 16th season with an authentically celebratory concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland last Friday.

Perhaps the primary reason for such a jubilant mood was that the evening also represented OEBS's 15th anniversary with the magnificent Michael Morgan as its conductor/music director.

The East Bay has a real treasure in Morgan -- and the community seems to know it.

The crowd that filled the large hall was as diversified as the area's general population both with regard to ethnicity and age. All seemed intent on lauding the good maestro, and with good reason. Because of Morgan and members of the orchestra, classical music is alive and flourishing in Oakland.

Morgan and small ensembles of OEBS musicians maintain an impressive schedule of visits, demonstrations, and chamber concerts to dozens of area elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the year.

The results are beginning to show. Oakland's Youth Orchestra continues to grow, tour, and win prizes. And, with Morgan's encouragement and blessing, so do a number of youth jazz and choral groups in the area.

In fact, the Oaktown Jazz Workshops ensemble, a group of Oakland students ranging from 13 to 17 under the tutelage of trumpeter and educator Kalil Shaheed, were tapped to provide the post-concert entertainment -- and garnered raves all around.

The OEBS has also attracted a very savvy group of committed board members and officers, headed by James A. Hasler as their president. And from the numbers of corporate, institutional, and individual supporters listed in the program, donations and public involvement appear to be on the upswing.

But most noticeable Friday night was the excellent quality of the musical performance coming from the Paramount stage.

Oakland's string section soared with luminous tone and virtuosic playing. Woodwinds were polished and mature in terms of solos and general ensemble. The percussion was likewise exemplary.

There appeared to be a number of personnel changes in the orchestra's ranks, which could have accounted for some occasional raggedness of ensemble and some perfunctory-sounding solos from the brass section Friday. More time and rehearsal together will no doubt spruce the section up to its former spit and polish.

The large number of women in the orchestra was also noticeable. There was not a single male member of the first violins. Seconds had only three men among a total of 10 players. Males dominated the string basses, and there were both genders in the cello section, although they were not listed on the program.

Following the official welcome by the velvet-voiced KDFC radio personality Dianne Nicolini, Morgan and the orchestra launched into the West Coast premiere of Nathaniel Stookey's "Big Bang," an interesting piece originally composed in 2001 to celebrate the opening of Meymandi Hall in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Audience members were forewarned that they were in for something novel when 150 crystal wine glasses were distributed to audienced members in the balcony. Each glass was filled with carefully measured amounts of water (watchfully supervised by the composer himself). Before beginning, Morgan advised those holding the glasses, that on his signal, each was to moisten his finger and run it along the rim of the glass until signaled to stop.

Although the audience "musicians" weren't called upon until the closing bars of the work, the effects were eerily wonderful and cosmic-sounding. (Morgan later revealed that the pitches sounding were those of the major triad plus an added ninth.)

According to Stookey, the title refers to the "Big Bang," the cosmological theory that the universe was born with a single big bang an estimated 20 billion years ago and has expanded outwards ever since.

Heads in clouds from Stookey's sounds were brought quickly down to earth as Shanghai-born pianist Tian Ying brought played the mesmerizing opening octaves of the famed Piano Concerto No. 3 (affectionately called the "Rach 3") by Sergei Rachmaninoff. The horns seamlessly joined in the theme while the violins proceeded to embellish it all beautifully with a series of artful roulades.

The piano can, of course, sound either like a percussion or a string instrument. However, under Ying's touch, the piano's string virtues were elegantly emphasized. He succeeded in playing the signature Rachmaninoff melodies with gracefully lyrical, even vocal-like, inflections and phrasing.

Morgan and the orchestra lent lushly expansive accompaniment through the thoughtful second movement, while still emphasizing some of Rachmaninoff's ingenious permutations of the primary theme.

However, the sonic fireworks and racing troika rhythms beginning the final movement seemed to get Ying's adrenalin racing so that his tempo got away with him.

But, he did exactly the right thing. He stopped.

He and Morgan then communicated a second or two before resuming the movement at a more controlled and manageable tempo. The result was a thrilling, cohesive success.

Ying showed that he is a pianist of immense power, but with fine poetic sense of interpretation -- even though he can, himself, get carried away with the thrill of the music.

The final work on the program was a satisfying performance of Brahms' Symphony No. 1. Although there were some in the audience who felt that the overall tempo was too fast, I did not. I was impressed with the power and coherency Morgan achieved with his chosen tempos. The inner melodic voices were cleanly evident and Brahms' signature duple and triple-cross rhythms were finely executed.

There were excellent solos from oboist Andrea Plesnarski, some crystalline playing by violinists Dawn Harms and Terrie Baune, the dual concertmasters, and an excellent ensemble sound achieved by the woodwind section.
