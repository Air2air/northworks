On Jan. 9, 2001, when Pamela Rosenberg stood before journalists, critics and media people packing the expansive lobby of San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, she said she believed that opera had the potential to make people think and feel more deeply about the human condition.

"My goal as your new general director," she said, "is to enable our audiences to see interconnections between life and art and to give them, through our 'Animating Opera' five-year program of themes, points of orientation to help them develop their own antennas."

She then clarified that the project would "be more than just intellectual" and promised that there would be "a Verdi in every season."

Summarizing, she said, "I want to spark curiosity in the audience."

Now, nearly five years later, she feels that this has happened.

During an interview last week in her office in the upper reaches of the San Francisco Opera House, she told me, "I think we've piqued the people's curiosity and convinced them to try new (operatic) experiences."
A sophisticated, warm, 5-foot, 11-inch tall woman with beautiful deep blue eyes and wheat-colored hair cut in a youthfully chic style, Rosenberg earnestly expressed the thought that there has been no downside to the adventurous programming of her San Francisco tenure.

"The unfamiliar and new works have sold no worse than the standards, and sometimes have done better," she said.

**Ambitious Francois\***

A case in point was the ambitious 2002 North American stage premiere of Olivier Messiaen's rather oblique  St. Francois d'Assise . Following its San Francisco run, the  New York Times  marveled, "The run of six performances sold better than Puccini's  Turandot , which was playing at the same time, with Jane Eaglen in the title role."

The report also noted that its last three performances were sold out, with lines of people standing outside the doors hoping for tickets.

Rosenberg stressed that she was equally happy about San Francisco's extravagantly praised production of Rossini's traditional  The Barber of Seville  as she was about the more abstract  St. Francis .

"Our  Barber , which even had Tom Hampson riding a motorcycle onstage, was sparkling and fun in an up-to-date way," she mused with a smile. "I am happy with how wide-ranging our opera presentations were and feel really proud of the things we produced ourselves."

She felt that the inclusion of Ferruccio Busoni's  Doktor Faust  provided much needed insight into the Faust legend. Also, that Janacek's  The Cunning Little Vixen  and his  Kat'a Kabanova  as well as Shostakovich's  Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk  ' although collaborations with other companies ' were likewise important milestones.

She is enthusiastic about the current  La Forza del Destino  production, describing it as a "long project that the company has really delved into.

"We've not done it historically," she said, "but have sought to show it more universally and focus on how war affects almost every aspect of everyday life."

**Lessons learned**

In answer to my question about what she has learned from her San Francisco Opera years, she grinned broadly and quipped, "I learned NOT to do  The Mother of Us All  on opening night!"

Another surprise was the negative audience reaction to the 2002 production of Handel's  Alcina .

"I was not prepared for  Alcina  to be so controversial. A Stuttgart production, we had done it countless times in Germany. We took it to the Edinburgh Festival, where it was named production of the year, after which it was shown and praised on television all over Europe. I was simply shocked that it was so controversial here in San Francisco."

Shrugging her shoulders, she said that a man sent her an e-mail telling her about a dinner party he had attended with seven other people who had seen  Alcina . Half of them hated it and half loved it. They discussed it for the entire evening.

"When is the last time you've been at a dinner party where you discussed an opera for the entire time?" she asked. "At least our production made them think."

She also admitted that she initially had fears about doing the huge  St. Francis  production in 2002.

"I was worried that doing  St. Francis  so early in the game might have be dangerous ' but it had the opposite effect. It turned out to be a fabulous way to begin. Although it was such a tremendous challenge for everyone in the company, the act of making it all happen together really bonded us all. We all ' the designers, the costumers, the set-builders, the chorus, the orchestra ' had a real sense of unity and togetherness from that point on," she said.

"I remember catching sight of the backstage manager walking across the stage with tears in her eyes after the curtain went down at the last performance. Concerned that something awful was wrong, I went over to her and asked if she was all right. She answered that she was fine, but was just sad that it was the last performance."

**Off to Berlin**

As Rosenberg nears the end of her final San Francisco Opera season, she's getting ready to head to the Berlin Philharmonic to become the first woman, as well as the first American, to serve as that vaunted organization's administrative director.

It will not be a big change for Rosenberg, however.

Between 1971 and 2001, she worked in Germany where she earned high honors for her 10 years as co-general director of the Stuttgart Opera, after working as manager of artistic affairs at the Netherlands Opera, director of operations for the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, and with the Frankfurt Opera.

Born Pamela Henry in California in 1945, she has spent much of her life abroad. Since her father was a naval officer, the family lived in Puerto Rico, then in Venezuela. Pamela came back to the States to attend high school in Pennsylvania and in Beverly Hills before enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley. During this youthful period she had spent 10 years as a serious piano student.

"I almost had a nervous breakdown trying to decide whether to major in history or music at Berkeley, but eventually settled into European and English history. By the time I graduated, though, I knew that I wanted to be a stage director ' preferably an opera director. During those years, I spent a lot of time in the standing room sections of the San Francisco opera and symphony."

After Berkeley, she went on to study with Wieland Wagner in Bayreuth, Germany, and then to the Guild Hall School of Music and Drama in London and the London Opera Centre, where she earned a diploma in stage management.

**Russian history scholar**

She completed a master's degree in Russian history at Ohio State University (for which she wrote her thesis on the Mensheviki) before settling in to work as a teaching assistant and assistant producer and stage manager for Ludwig Zirner's opera program at the University of Illinois in Urbana.

She had a full life indeed in Illinois. She met and married composer-musicologist Wolf Rosenberg in 1968 (he died in 1996) and in 1970, their twin boys, Paolo and Sascha, were born. During that period, she and Wolf, who was a visiting composer/professor at University of Illinois, co-wrote a musical performance work called  Crockett . It subsequently received a performance at Carnegie Hall.

Looking forward to her Berlin appointment beginning in January, she explained that the present Berlin Philharmonic under British-born conductor Simon Rattle is a far different, more forward-looking organization than it was in the conservative von Karajan years. The famed orchestra now has 19 different nationalities represented in its ranks as well as a lot of women. The average age of its members is 37.

There are also strong family ties pulling her back to Germany.

Her son Paolo, a film producer based in Frankfurt, is father to her two grandchildren, Nico, 11 and Leonie, 6. Paolo's fraternal twin, Sascha, works in Berlin is a television journalist with Deutsche Welle. Both are over 6 feet, 2 inches tall and movie-star handsome. (Both sons took off to be with their mom in San Francisco when she was awarded the prestigious San Francisco Opera Medal in a surprise ceremony on opening night for the 2005 season.)

At the close of our interview, Pamela repeated that she thinks San Franciscans have a uniquely high commitment to opera as a living art form.

"Other people in the world buy their tickets, attend and then go home," she stressed. "In San Francisco, they are absolutely passionate about it.

"But," she added, "I hope in future years, the period from 2001 to 2005 in San Francisco will be remembered as a time of great artistic enrichment and vibrancy."
