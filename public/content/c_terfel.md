                                          Bryn Terfel doesn't look like an opera star. Moreover, on a one-to-one basis,
                                          he doesn't ACT like one either. But, make no mistake, the husky Welsh
                                          bass-baritone, now in his mid-30's, is one of the operatic world's greatest
                                          treasures. He has just completed a stint singing the role of the diabolical
                                          Nick Shadow in the San Francisco Opera's recent production of "The Rake's
                                          Progress," by Igor Stravinsky. Earlier this month, he performed a sold-out,

                                          critically acclaimed solo recital with pianist Malcolm Martineau at Zellerbach
                                          Hall on the UC Berkeley campus.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Although the 6 foot 3-inch singer is often awesome and larger than life on the
                                          operatic stage, he was unassuming and friendly one afternoon a couple of years
                                          ago as he personally led me down the narrow back-stage hall leading to his
                                          dressing room at the San Francisco Opera house for a hastily scheduled
                                          interview. Dressed in a casual golf shirt and slightly crumpled pants, he had
                                          a benign, hail-fellow-well-met presence and bonhomie that made me think of
                                          Smoky the Bear.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          But, as he spoke, images of the late Richard Burton, a fellow Welshman, came
                                          quickly to mind. Terfel, like Burton, seems to caress each word he speaks,
                                          burnishing the English language with a warm Welsh burr.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          His singing voice is one of the truly magnificent instruments of the 20th
                                          century with a massiveness that warms the soul like a blazing hearth fire on a
                                          snowy night. It is a keenly focused voice with huge proportions, yet it is
                                          flexible and has a texture one critic dubbed "like cashmere." Moreover he has
                                          a way with phrasing similar to Frank Sinatra in his salad days and like
                                          Sinatra, he can imbue a song (or an aria) with an immediacy and intimacy that
                                          can reach out and grab an audience.

                                    <p></p>
                                          Yet, Terfel the man is amazingly modest and unassuming in demeanor and
                                          deportment.
                                          "I didn't really plan to be a singer," he said. "I was interested in sports
                                          when I was young and played soccer and rugby. Had I not gotten into singing, I
                                          probably would have become a policeman or a fireman," he continued, as the
                                          corners of his eyes crinkled along with his smile.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Terfel and his brother, now a physical education teacher, were born on a sheep
                                          and cattle farm in Pantglas, Wales, a small village in the country's rugged
                                          north. While sports were his greatest interest growing up, music did play an
                                          important role. Both his father and mother sang in church choirs and he easily
                                          followed in their footsteps.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          "It was just part of village life," he says of singing in Wales. "It was
                                          something that brought people together and we simply enjoyed yourselves."
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Terfel also took piano lessons, tried trumpet, clarinet, and guitar, and
                                          regularly sang in the local Welsh singing contests (eisteddfods). Whenever he
                                          won one of the monetary prizes in a contest (about $20), he would usually use
                                          the money to buy football boots or a bit of sports equipment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          However, as his teenage years drew to a close, he was urged by a music teacher
                                          to head for London to audition for a music school. Although he had indeed sung
                                          a lot in his youth, opera was not part of his early training. Like most
                                          teenagers, his musical interests centered on pop and rock and his favorites
                                          were Elvis Presley, Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and Queen.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          "If someone had asked me who Pavarotti was when I was 16, I couldn't have told
                                          them," he said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          As a result of the teacher's prodding, for the first time in their lives, Bryn
                                          and his parents set out for London where he was to audition for the Guildhall
                                          School of Music and Drama. Going to London was "like culture shock," he says.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          And - in London, it was vini, vidi, vinci. He came, he saw, and he conquered.
                                          He was not only accepted at Guildhall, he was awarded a scholarship. While
                                          there he studied voice with Arthur Reckless and Rudolf Piernay and haunted the
                                          school library where he listened to opera and song recordings and studied
                                          scores. In his last Guildhall year he entered a competition and walked away
                                          with the school's Gold Medal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Since then he has won the Kathleen Ferrier Competition, one of the most
                                          prestigious in Britain, as well as the Lieder (art song) prize in the highly
                                          visible "Singer of the World" competition in Cardiff, Wales in 1989. (Another
                                          young baritone, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, won the first prize that year).
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Terfel's subsequent ascent into the stratosphere of operatic superstardom has
                                          continued with rocket speed. He has appeared in Strauss" "Salome;" Wagner's
                                          "Das Rheingold;" as Wolfram in Wagner's "Tannhauser;" Scarpia in Puccini's
                                          "Tosca;" Verdi's "Falstaff;" Offenbach's "Les Contes d"Hoffmann;" Britten's
                                          "Peter Grimes;" has sung the roles of both Leporello and the Don in Mozart's
                                          "Don Giovanni;" and Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" and in productions of
                                          "The Marriage of Figaro" with the Welsh National Opera; English National
                                          Opera; Santa Fe Opera; Royal Opera, Covent Garden; the Salzburg Festival; New
                                          York's Metropolitan Opera; Chatelet in Paris; Lisbon Opera; and at La Scala in
                                          Milan. And, to the opera world's great delight, he has finally contracted to
                                          sing his first "Wotan" in Wagner's "Das Rheingold" in Munich in 2001.

                                          His recordings of Schubert's "Schwanengesang;" "An Die Musik: Lieder;" "The
                                          Vagabond;" Rodgers and Hammerstein hits; Lerner and Lowe favorites, have
                                          earned kudos from audiences and critics alike.

                                          He has also worked with some of the world's greatest conductors, including the
                                          late great Sir Georg Solti, of whom he says, "It was like working with a God.
                                          He was 84 at the time, but his energy and enthusiasm levels put everybody else
                                          to shame."
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          "As an opera singer, your path is pretty well sorted out and planned six years
                                          in advance," he says. "Yet, I can't complain. I'm in a very fortunate position
                                          with my career now. I can more or less pick and choose whatever I want to do.
                                          I have a contract with Deutsche Grammophon and they are very flexible with my
                                          brainstorms. I hope to even record some Gilbert &amp; Sullivan one day."
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          Nevertheless, he maintains close links with his Welsh roots. He regularly
                                          sends postcards back to the Pantglas Post Office, which are, in turn, posted
                                          on a board for all the locals to share and he meets as often as possible with
                                          the mates he grew up and still considers among his closest friends. All this
                                          is helped along, no doubt, by his marriage to his childhood sweetheart,
                                          Lesley, and the subsequent birth of their son, Tomos, now three-years-old.
                                          (Tomos is the Welsh spelling for Thomas).
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          "We met in primary school," he says of Lesley. "She's my best friend and
                                          critic. You've got to have somebody to tell you the truth about how you're
                                          doing, and she does!" He also noted happily that Lesley and Tomos often
                                          traveled right along with him.
                                    </p>

                                          Terfel remains keen on sports, but due to the constraints of his singing
                                          career, his former jousts on soccer or rugby fields have been replaced by
                                          milder forays at snooker and golf. Recent back surgery has also slowed his
                                          athletic activities a bit.

                                          Although he has enormous respect for fellow baritones like Dmitri
                                          Hvorostovsky, Thomas Hampson, and the like, he doesn't foresee any combining
                                          of forces for a baritone equivalent of "The Three Tenors."

                                          "We're all in the same lake, so to speak, but we're all in different boats,"
                                          he says.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>He also retains his eclectic taste in music and recounted rather gleefully his
                                          appearance on British television several Christmases ago with fellow Welshman
                                          Tom Jones.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          "The show was called "Tom Jones and Friends,"" he said, "and included me, the
                                          American singer Toni Braxton and Mark Knofler of "Dire Straits." Jones and I
                                          sang "Green, Green Grass of Home" as a duet."
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          He also noted that, although an opera singer's life resembles that of
                                          supermodels and stars like Cindy Crawford, Pierce Brosnan, and the like, with
                                          stops along the same circuit - Milan, Paris, London, New York - the
                                          accompanying fame is not at the same level. "It's the kind of stardom that
                                          allows us to go to the corner Safeway and be treated like everybody else," he
                                          said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                          As an example, he recounted the occasion during his last visit to San
                                          Francisco when he, Lesley, Tomos, and the nanny all dropped into San
                                          Francisco's Planet Hollywood. "The food was great and I didn't seem to be
                                          recognized. Maybe someone thought I was Gerard Depardieu or something because
                                          of my nose - I wracked it up two or three times on the rugby field - but no
                                          one singled me out for special treatment. That was cool."

                                          The inimitable Bryn Terfel, whom Lotfi Mansouri agrees is "a force of nature,"
                                          will further display his remarkable versatility during a Cal Performances
                                          recital featuring songs by Hugo Wolf; Robert Schumann; Brahms (``Vier Ernste
                                          Gesange''); Butterworth; John Ireland; Hubert Parry; Roger Quilter; Michael
                                          Herad; Idris Lewis; as well as a number of traditional Welsh songs, at 8 p.m.
                                          Saturday in Zellerbach Hall on the University of California campus in
