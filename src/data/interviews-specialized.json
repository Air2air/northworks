        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Ildar Abdrazakov prior to his performance in the title role of Boito's * Mefistofele* for the Opening Night of the San Francisco Opera**\n\nMaterial from the Classical Music Column posted August 30, 2013, Bay Area News Group, under the headline, \"Cheryl North: Ildar Abdrazakov sings like the devil in San Francisco Opera's *Mefistofele*\n\nAre all basses either ferocious bad guys, cunning cheats or worst of all, devils in the world of opera?\n\nI had an interview date with one of opera's infamous devils last week during which I asked him just that question. And this particular \"devil\" also claims to be a direct descendant of Genghis Khan!\n\nHis name is Ildar Abdrazakov, (pronounced Ab-dra-ZAH-kov), and he was born 37 years ago in Ufa, the capital city of Bashkortostan, also the birthplace of the late great ballet star Rudolf Nureyev. Now a Republic in the Russian Federation, the area was likely one of Genghis' old haunts back in the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nBut no need to fear. Abdrazakov is not here in the Bay Area to wreak havoc. Rather, he is singing the title role in Arrigo Boito's magnificent opera, *Mefistofele*, on San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House stage from Sept. 3 through Oct. 2. San Francisco Opera music director Nicola Luisotti will conduct. Abdrazakov's co-stars will be tenor Ramon Vargas, soprano Patricia Racette and a huge chorus.\n\nAbdrazakov, a tall, handsome Bashkir with a shock of thick black hair, a broad, playful smile and an iron-man build, has had ample experience in the portrayal of opera's devils. In addition to Boito's bad guy, he's sung the alternatively spelled Mephistopheles role in Gounod's *Faust*, as well as Berlioz's *La Damnation de Faust. Vargas, now his close friend, has sung Faust to Abdrazakov's Mephistopheles in productions of all three of these operas based on Johann von Goethe's famed 1806 novel.\n\nSome of Abdrazakov's other bad-guy portrayals have been wicked English King Henry VIII in Donizetti's Anna Bolena*, as well as the doomed-to-be-damned title role in Mozart's *Don Giovanni* and the ferocious conqueror in Verdi's *Attila. On the concert stage, he's sung the sepulchral declamations of the devilish tsar in Prokofiev's cantata, Ivan the Terrible*. In spite of his admission that he would someday like to sing the role of yet one more bass bad guy, the tilte role in Mussorgsky's *Boris Godunov*, he assured me that there were indeed some rather merry good guy basses who get the girl (or at least enjoy romantic interludes with her) on operatic stages. Among these are Massenet's *Don Quichotte*,\" a role he would one day like to sing, and of course, Mozart's *The Marriage of Figaro*, a role he has often sung.\n\nConsidering Abdrazakov's origins, it's no surprise that he should be so musical. His late father was a stage and film director and his mother, a painter. Askar, his elder brother by seven years, is also a well-trained operatic bass. The two of them starred together in Verdi's *Aida* and recently sang the roles of the Don and sidekick Leporello in the Washington National Opera's *Don Giovanni* production.\n\nYoung Ildar began acting in his father's productions at age 4. By age 6, he was enrolled in a music school, where he began piano lessons and sang with the children's chorus. The piano, however, was a pain to him. Contorting his face into a grimace and his voice into a wail, he said \"I could hear my friends outside playing soccer while I was expected to stay inside practicing the piano. It was like torture!\"\n\nFortunately, his choral director came to the rescue. Noting the boy's beautiful, clear voice and excellent ear for music, he suggested that Ildar should change schools and concentrate on voice. By age 16, his clear soprano had changed to a resonant basso cantante.\n\nAfter graduating from the Ufa State Institute of the Arts, he joined the Bashkirian Opera and Ballet Theatre. By the late 1990s, he had won a number of vocal competitions, including the Moscow Grand Prix and both the Glinka and Rimsky-Korsakov competitions. Conductor Valery Gergiev heard him sing when he was 22. As a result, he made his Maryinsky Opera debut as Figaro in Mozart's *The Marriage of Figaro* with Anna Netrebko as Susanna. In 2000, he won the Maria Callas International Television Competition in Parma, Italy, after which he made his international debut in *La Sonambula* at La Scala in Milan. Since then, he has risen to become one of the world's greatest basses and is in great demand by conductors in opera houses all over the world.\n\n![](/images/ildar-abdrazakov-and-cheryl-north.jpg)\n\nIldar Abdrazakov with Cheryl North, backstage at the San Francisco Opera House, after an October performance of Mefistophele\n\n[.](http://www.northworks.net)\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Laura Aikin**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for February 18, 2005, under headline,* Super Mon, super Singer -- that's soprano Aikin\n\n\"THE voice of an angel\" is an oft-used phrase used to describe soprano Laura Aikin's singing.\n\nAikin, the unforgettable blue angel with only one wing in\nthe San Francisco Opera production of Messian's *Saint Fran'ois d'Assise* a couple of years ago, wowed audiences and critics alike with her amazing crystalline voice and playfully mysterious interpretation.\nThe role required athletic ability and balance, both of which she had in abundance, as she sang while suspended on wires and platforms high above the opera house stage.\n\nOnce again, Aikin is doing the angel thing in San Francisco ' albeit this time it's a \"fallen\" angel ' in the San Francisco Symphony's performances of Robert Schumann's *Das Paradies und die Peri.* The last of three performances of this lovely, lyrical piece, which Schumann himself termed \"an oratorio for happy people,\" is at 8 tonight.\n\nAikin was born and raised in a rural suburb outside of Buffalo, N.Y.\n\n\"I was the youngest of five girls growing up in a house with only one bathroom,\" she told me during an interview Monday in her San Francisco hotel room. She described her father as a foreman at a metal casting plant and her mother as a dedicated stay-at-home mom.\n\nWhile in high school she became proficient playing trumpet, baritone horn and piano. She was also interested in acting. Although she was aware that she could sing rather well, she didn't take it very seriously until one day, while auditioning for a high school musical, the music director asked her to sing some scales for him.\n\nThe small 15-year-old straightened up, took a breath and proceeded to pour out three octaves of gorgeous tone, ending up with a ringingly perfect high \"C.\" It was something she had never done before.\n\nHe was shocked ' and her life was changed forever.\n\n*\n\nThe first person in her extended family to go to college, she spent the next 10 years earning four diplomas from three universities and a German government fellowship (DAAD) to study in Munich. She soon earned several contract offers from opera houses throughout Germany. The one she accepted was the ensemble of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, where she spent six years.\n\nBesides performing a variety of operatic roles in Berlin, Aikin earned a reputation as one of Europe's leading young sopranos. During that time she married Gianluca Pojaghi, a handsome young lawyer from Milan, and in the final year of her contract gave birth to Marcello, now 7.\n\nAikin keeps on developing her rare mettle. In addition to having become a gold-standard opera star, she's also one of the rare women able to combine the rigors of child rearing with a full-blown operatic career.\n\nAfter arriving at her San Francisco hotel for our interview, I was courteously ushered into her room by her elegant Italian mother-in-law. Dressed in pants and a colorful sweater, Laura was sitting cross-legged in the middle of her bed tenderly cradling a tiny pink-clad ball of fluff in her arms. She motioned me in, asking if I minded working while sitting on the edge of bed while she finished nursing her 4-week-old daughter.\n\nWith a smile that can aptly be described as \"angelic,\" she introduced wee Virginia and said, \"She's the third 'Ginny' in my family. Virginia was my late mother's name, too.\"\n\nShe added, \"Although we live in Milan, I went to Berlin to give birth, since there is a very good natural childbirth program there. When I first felt serious labor pains, I went in to the piano and sang through the whole of my 'Das Paradies' part, not knowing how long it would be until I could practice again.\"\n\nThe birth went well; Aikin showed me a picture taken an hour or so after the birth in which she's sitting in her hospital bed holding Ginny, with husband Gianluca smiling triumphantly on her left and Marcello grinning broadly on her right.\n\n\"Maybe Ginny will grow up to be a conductor. At just 15 minutes old, she stopped crying and listened with great attention as I played a recording of the 'Adagietto' movement from Mahler's Symphony No. 5. It could have been because she had heard it before. It was part of a special recording of baby-friendly music I put on my computer and played all during the pregnancy.\"\n\nPlucky gal that she is, Laura was even lauded for her portrayal of Konstanza in Mozart's Die Entf'hrung aus dem Serail* in October and November (eight months into her pregnancy!) in Frankfurt. She said the cast had great fun with the production by acknowledging her \"condition\" and implying that, just maybe, the papa might be the Pasha.\n\nAfter tonight's performance in San Francisco, Laura, Ginny and \"Nana\" will head for New York City, where Laura will begin rehearsals for Strauss' *Der Rosenkavalier*\" scheduled to open March 7 at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nBut lest Laura be forever typecast as an angel, her favorite role happens to be \"Lulu\" by Alban Berg ' a lady about as far as possible from the angel category. She said, \"Vocally, Lulu is a dream ' and psychologically, it goes to the core of the human side of being a woman.\"\n\nGuest conductor Ingo Metzmacher conducts the San Francisco Symphony and Chorus in Schumann's *Das Paradies und die Peri*\" tonight at Davies Symphony Hall, 201 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco. Other vocal soloists are Kristine Jepson, Christoph Pregardien, William Dazeley, Jane Archibald, Ronit Widmann-Levy, Sonia Gariaeff and Catherine Cook.\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Elinor Armer**\n\n*ANG Newspapers, 1995*\n\nIt takes a creative sort of person to see a relationship between plate tectonics and music. Berkeley composer Elinor Armer, and her artistic collaborator, science fiction/fantasy writer Ursula Le Guin, feel that the two indeed interrelate and they have just completed the last element of a set of pieces with this in mind.\n\nThis latest piece, *Island Earth*, will receive its world premiere tonight at 8 p.m. at Zellerbach Hall on the University of California, Berkeley campus when it is played by the Women's Philharmonic orchestra under the baton of JoAnn Falletta. Besides orchestra, the piece will involve the San Francisco Boys' Chorus and 23-member \"Uttermost Men's Chorus.\"\n\nLe Guin describes *Island Earth* as dealing with \"the formation of the Earth, using the splendid images of plate tectonics, volcanism and island building. Geology is the science of Time and Earth, and the drama of the interplay of Time's vastness and Earth's living, ever-changing being.\"\n\nAccording to the quick-witted, genial Armer, such imagery lends itself beautifully and naturally to music. \"Music is the Art of time,\" she posited during a telephone interview last Wednesday.\n\nShe explained that the collaboration with Le Guin began nine years ago when the two came upon the idea of creating a work to describe an archipelago of fantasy islands in which music is paramount. \"What if music could be used as food? Or water? What if it functioned as roads, walls, weaving, or a love potion?\" she said.\n\nThe women named their fantasy islands and the music describing them, *The Uttermost Archipelago*. It consists of eight separate sections or pieces chronicling the \"exploration\" of the individual island in the archipelago. [Note added in 2005: *Uses of Music in Uttermost Parts* is the name on [Ursula Le Guin's website](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/bio.html) for a 1995 composition described as seven pieces for orchestra, chamber group, voice, and/or chorus, music by Elinor Armer, recorded by Koch International Classics. There is no mention of an eighth piece or of another composition with music by Armer and text by Le Guin.]\n\n\"On each island, music is used in a different way,\" says Armer. \"On the isle of Hoi, it is food and we use a mixed chorus. On Oling, music is weather and we use a chamber group consisting of cello, viola, piano, percussion and narrator. A girls chorus performs in `Anithaca, the Island of the Daughters of Penelope' and their music is highly contrapuntal as it depicts weaving on a giant loom.\"\n\nSince the project has grown to such large proportions and utilizes such a variety of musical ensembles, it is difficult to assemble the resources to do the whole thing live. As a result, the entire eight-part work will be recorded for KOCH International Classics following tonight's premiere of its final section, *Island Earth*.\n\nArmer was born in Oakland in 1939 and raised in Davis. Her creativity was fostered by her father, Austin Armer, an acoustical engineer who invented stereophonic sound reproduction and even coined the \"stereophonic,\" and her mother Alberta, a writer of children's books.\n\nHer penchant for composition was ignited when her parents started her on piano lessons at age eight with Olive Shipstead of Davis.\n\nRemembers Armer, \"Mrs. Shipstead gave me a great deal of ear training and harmonic and rhythmic dictation along with teaching me how to play the piano. She sharpened my ears and made it all into playful games. And she often had me make up and play my own pieces.\"\n\n*\n\nMills College, from which she graduated in 1961, provided even further stimulation. She proceeded on to graduate study at UC Berkeley and received a Master of Arts degree in composition from California State University, San Francisco. Darius Mihaud, Leon Kirchner, Roger Nixon and Alexander Liberman were among her teachers.\n\nNow the chairman of the composition department at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, she has received national recognition for her performed, published, and recorded works. She also remains an important advocate of new music and is a founding member of the Bay Area Contemporary music series, a member of the American Music Center and the Society of Composers, Incorporated, and has received awards and honors from the MacDowell Colony, the Charles Ives Center for American Music, Yaddo, the Djerassi Foundation, and more. She is also in frequent demand as a panelist, reviewer and adjudicator and has served on advisory panels for NEA and the U.S. Information Agency.\n\nIn spite of her many academic accolades, however, her musical style is very accessible, rhythmically lively and reflects her tonal background. \"I am a very harmonic animal,\" she emphasizes, \"and I almost always base my music on a program _ even when there is no specific text, there is a sort of narration going on in my mind. For this reason, my collaboration with Le Guin was a complete joy _ it freed my imagination. And I've always enjoyed playing popular music and jazz by ear. My music, I think, is all the better for it.\"\n\nPlayfulness and humor also play a part in her music. \"I take playing very seriously and think it is essential to survival,\" she says. \"We suffer when we're deprived of play. Art is, in fact, a form of human play.\"\n\nOf the current state of creative music in the world, she says, \"We've had an explosion of musical languages in the 20th century _ and because of the quick worldwide communication through the mass media, things are evolving faster. Music has a shorter shelf life now than it did before my father's stereophonic sound.\"\n\nWith the verbal facility of a philosopher, she characterized mid-20th century music as being rather academic, technically skillful and taking on the properties of intellectual systems. \"It was more science than art,\" she says.\n\n\"But lately, we seem to be longing for more pure artistic expression. There may be some reversion to art with purely human values _ art that touches the emotions.\"\n\nIn agreement is Frank LaRoca, a professor of composition and music theory at California State University, Hayward, and one of Armer's fellow founders of Composers, Inc.\n\nSays LaRocca, \"Elinor is so quick with the bon mot -- an extremely bright woman in everything she does. You see it in her conversation, her incredibly quick wit and her ability to use words in the most surprising ways.\"\n\n\"Her music,\" he continued, \"shows that same spark of intelligence in a mind that is able to instantly create associations and streams of thought that are always original, refreshing, and meaningful. There's great substance to what she has to say.\"\n\nAnd after sitting in on several performances given throughout the Bay Area this week of sections of her Uttermost Archipelago*, she said with a smile in her voice, \"I think I am becoming recognized for my music now - and not just for my gender.\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\nFeature article in the British publication, Opera Now**, 2000\n\nCapital punishment is a highly charged issue in the US. Now opera is entering the debate with the forthcoming world premiere of Dead Man Walking at San Francisco Opera. Cheryl Bonham-North reports*\n\nOperas have been written about virtually every aspect of human experience. While libretti fairly brim with cases of mistaken identity, romance, slapstick comedy, and all manner of noble quests, they also spill over into incidents of fratricide, patricide, suicide and murder, not to mention incest, rape - and execution. So San Francisco Opera's upcoming world premiere of *Dead Man Walking*, a story that explores the controversial and emotive moral issues surrounding capital punishment culminating in the execution of a rapist-murderer, isn't as far-fetched a subject for an opera as some might think.\n\n*Dead Man Walking*, scheduled to open in San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House on 7 October, is a grim, moving autobiographical story based on a book by Sister Helen Prejean CSJ, a Roman Catholic nun who has spent her life pursuing her vocation in her home state of Louisiana. She wrote *Dead Man Walking* after serving, in 1982, as a spiritual counsellor for Patrick Sonnier, a convicted rapist-killer of two teenagers, who was sentenced to die in the electric chair at Louisiana's Angola State Prison. Published in 1993, the book earned numerous awards. It was on *The New York Times*' best-seller list for 31 weeks, graduated to the international best-seller list, and has been translated into eight different languages.\n\n*Dead Man Walking* was released as a film in 1996. It starred Susan Sarandon as Sister Helen and Sean Penn as the inmate on death row, renamed Matt Poncelet for the purposes of the movie. Tim Robbins wrote the screenplay and directed the film, which subsequently received Oscar nominations for best actor, best actress, best song, and best director - Sarandon won the best actress award. Many who saw the movie considered it one of the more emotional, even traumatic, experiences of their lives - I certainly did.\n\nHow could a subject as charged as capital punishment possibly be addressed in an opera? I asked Jake Heggie, the composer of *Dead Man Walking*: \"I cried a lot!\" admitted 39-year-old Heggie. \"But then I began to see it not just as a story about the death penalty in our country, but rather, as a journey taken by the two main characters and their injured families - the families of the victims as well as those of the victimiser. It's neither a documentary nor a musical version of the movie. It's contemporary, but timeless; very American, yet universal. It deals with something that every country and every civilisation has had to deal with since time began: the question of who decides who lives and who dies. It's also about redemption versus damnation, and then, the really big one - forgiveness. That [forgiveness] is the big journey in life - the one thing that will give a person peace of mind.\"\n\nIt took many months for Heggie, librettist Terrence McNally, and Lotfi Mansouri, San Francisco Opera's General Manager, to agree on *Dead Man Walking* as a subject for opera. The idea of commissioning Heggie to write a new opera actually had its genesis in Mansouri's mind back in 1997. Mansouri considered the young composer to have what he describes as \"an incredible talent for expressing the human condition through, song and voice\" and as a musician who \"really understands how the voice works.\" He also admires McNally as \"one of the finest playwrights of our time\" and had long wanted him to write an opera libretto. Mansouri tapped into the resources of Chase Manhattan Private Bank to create an ongoing Chase Composer-in-Residence Program, designating Heggie the first recipient. The purpose of the program, Mansouri says, is \"to provide a wide variety of new works of every scale - at the rate of one new opera per year\" His hopes are \"that operas written by future composers-in-residence will be produced for the main stage of San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House as well as for other venues, depending on the size and scope of the individual compositions.\"\n\nThrough his Pacific Visions Program, which he established in 1992, Mansouri was the catalyst for commissioning Andre Previn as composer and Philip Littell as librettist for *A Streetcar Named Desire*, based on the Tennessee Williams stage play, and Conrad Susa and Philip Littell to team up to write music and libretto for *Les Liasons Dangereuses*, based on the 18th-century novel by Choderlos de Laclos. Similarly, Mansouri was instrumental in commissioning Stewart Wallace and Michael Korie to create an opera based on the life and death of the San Francisco politician and gay rights advocate, *Harvey Milk*, a joint endeavour with the Houston Grand Opera and the New York City Opera.\n\nThe choice of Sister Helen Prejean's *Dead Man Walking* as the subject for this latest commission, was not Mansouri's, but rather, McNally's. According to Heggie, when Mansouri initially approached him with the idea of writing an opera, the General Director suggested a comedy! After Heggie and McNally were introduced, they spent about nine fruitless months brainstorming through possible subjects for their opera. Then, while on a plane en route to yet another meeting with Heggie, McNally wrote out a list of the subjects they were considering. He had recently read Sister Helen's book, and included it along with his other potential subjects. By the time his flight ended, he had crossed out every title on his list except *Dead Man Walking*. When McNally first told Heggie that he hoped to base the opera on *Dead Man Walking*, Heggie remembers that \"all the hairs on my body seemed to stand on end. I knew the choice was inspired.\"\n\nWhen I approached McNally, he was working with composer-lyricist David Yazbek touching up last-minute details for the New York opening of their new musical play, *The Full Monty*. He took time out to share his thoughts about *Dead Man Walking* with me via e-mail. \"I knew for a long time, that if I were ever going to write a full-length opera, I would be hoping to find a contemporary story that concerned itself with people I could care about who were attempting to deal with a difficult moment in their lives,\" he wrote. He noted that these were pretty much the same criteria he used when trying to come up with an original idea for a play, and added, \"Obviously, *DMW* met these criteria.\"\n\nSo why didn't he write a play based on Sister Helen's book instead of an opera? He explained that, given the magnitude of the subject matter, it seemed more suited to an opera than a play. \"I think music adds a dimension to a story that words can only suggest. In this case, the emotions are so big, complex and mysterious, music can amplify them, allow them to grow. It's a big story, it's inherently operatic, it's about a subject we all think about, even if we pretend our minds are 100 per cent made up on the order. I think the subject-matter reaches us in a very fundamental place.\"\n\nAfter the decision on *DMW* was finalised with Mansouri and Sister Helen, McNally took Jake Heggie to his house in Key West, Florida, to begin work. Although they had talked about the plot for several months, McNally spun out the libretto for Act I in about four days. He told Heggie that he would initially approach it as though he were writing a play and hope that it inspired music. It did.\n\n\"It was my job to translate that kind of emotion and searing conflict into music,\" Heggie said - and after a long hesitation, added, \"That's why I was in tears so much of the time during its composition.\" Heggie found McNally to be a wonderful collaborator. \"He told me to let the music take over if I came across something in the libretto that didn't quite fit. Soon, the libretto took shape because the music took us there.\"\n\nFor Heggie, working on the opera was very much a give-and-take creative process. He always \"tried to get into the head of the person speaking\" and then, as he did so, he could write the sort of melodic line which would fit each character and their mood. Heggie's compositional style is refreshingly lyrical, since he believes that the human voice is built to sing long, lyric lines. He has an almost Schubertian affinity for and facility with song and his compositions, as a result, have attracted some of the world's best singers, many of whom have either included Heggie selections in their recitals or on their recordings. Among these are Frederick von Stade, Brian Asawa, Renee Fleming, Earle Patriarco, and more. Soprano Jennifer Larmore writes in the programme notes of her latest CD, \"... it's amazing how he [Heggie] assumes the identity of his texts.\" What's more, Heggie's piano skills are such that he is often sought as an accompanist or soloist. While much of the music for *Dead Man Walking* has an almost bel canto lyricism, there are times when the plot requires angry, angular, or abrupt qualities. \"When you're in a violent environment like a prison ward or on death row, you're not going to hear melodies with arching, long lines,\" Heggie says. \"But, when Joe [the inmate in the opera is renamed Joe de Rocher] is finally able to sing such lines, they become all the more touching and tender.\"\n\nBoth the music and libretto for Act I were completed in four months. Act II took five additional months, and the orchestration about five more months.\n\nMichael Yeargan, the very literate designer of the opera's sets, describes the tension in the music as \"almost like heading to a car wreck. The suspense is unbelievable - lush music, combined with this rock 'n' roll radio at the murder scene. Heggie's music has an incredible rhythm, like the ticking of a clock - like High Noon, leading you to the final moment. We've tried to orchestrate our [stage] images as they're orchestrating the music.\" I asked John Packard, the baritone cast as Joe to describe his approach to the role: \"Although Joe is a monster, he is still a human being. Will he find redemption? It's not plausible but when I read through the score, the music captures it - it's possible. I'm honoured to be doing it.\"\n\nSister Helen, too, was a frequent collaborator throughout the opera's creation. She made it clear to both composer and librettist that she considered fidelity to the spirit of the work to be more important than the chronological details.\n\nAccording to Heggie, the final result is somewhat abstract. \"Abstraction allows the characters to occupy this large psychological space,\" he said. \"We wanted the situation to be somewhat familiar in the public consciousness, but yet we needed to be allowed some creative freedom and flexibility. Think of a big quiet pond. Then imagine a huge rock thrown into the middle of it. Ripples range out through the whole pond and touch everything that borders it. The rock is the ugly crime. The ripples then wreak havoc with the families - even the criminal's mother and brothers - as well as society as a whole.\"\n\nMcNally, Heggie, and Sister Helen both hope that the opera doesn't necessarily make people feel sorry for the criminal, but that they are brought to a recognition that he is a fellow human, and that two wrongs don't necessarily make a right. To illustrate, Heggie recounted a personal experience: \"Once, when my brother and I were arguing about the death penalty, he asked me if I would favour someone like Joe being put to death if his victim had been our mother. I answered by asking him if he would still favour the death penalty if the person who committed the crime had been one of his own children.\"\n\nSince her encounter with Patrick Sonnier, Sister Helen has counselled two additional death row inmates and witnessed their deaths. She continues her ministry to inmates, their families and those of their victims, and is currently working on a book about women's struggle for equality in the Roman Catholic Church. In her warm singsong Southern accent, she affirmed that \"There was not one major snag in the transition of my story into an opera. Terrence and Jake really saw it as the essential human conflict that it was.\" She told me how the music was beginning to affect its listeners, even before the first official performance. \"Jake told me about a recent meeting of some big bankers who were considering backing the opera,\" she said. After a few selections from the score were performed, many of them were so moved, that they cried!\"\n\nOne of America's starriest singers on the international opera scene, mezzo Susan Graham, has been chosen to sing the role of Sister Helen, with Kristine Jepson scheduled to sing the role for one performance. Frederica von Stade takes on the role of the inmate's mother. Australian baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes will sing the role of Joe for one performance. San Francisco Opera's Principal Guest Conductor Patrick Summers will conduct, while Joe Mantello directs.\n\n![](/images/title-gray-dead.gif)\n\n![](/images/opera-now-cover.jpg)\n\n![](/images/dmw-1.jpg)\n\nThree sisters: Susan Sarandon (center) from the film version of 'Dead Man Walking', flanked by Susan Graham (right) who played the lead in the opera, and the real Sister Helen Prejean.\n\n![](/images/dmw-2.jpg)\n\nMichael Yeargan's design for the bleak prison setting of the Opera\n\n![](/images/dmw-3.jpg)\n\nThe creative team of Dead Man Walking, left to right: Jake Heggie, Terence McNally, Patrick Summers and Joe Montello.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### Cheryl North Column, based on an interview\n\n with Brent Assink, on the new \"6.5\" Format\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - October 28, 2005*,\nunder\nheadline,**\"Come to S.F. Symphony for the New Early Show**\n\nONE OF THE fascinations about great classical music is that there doesn't seem to be any limit on how much you can learn about it.\n\nPerhaps hearing a great work of music for the first time is a bit like trekking into a dark cave: You don't quite know what you're in for at the entry. As you progress, however, you discover a bend here, a bump there, and you begin to sense some of its properties.\n\nBut since caves are usually deep and dark, you can't easily make out exactly what surrounds you ' until someone turns on a flashlight or lights a match.\n\nThe light might illuminate a seam of glistening quartz coursing along one wall, a cache of bats hanging sleepily from the ceiling, or perhaps a little water bubbling up from an area down a previously unseen corridor. All sorts of contours, colors and objects hidden in the darkness become apparent as a light is shone on them.\n\nThat's much like what happens when one first \"enters\" into a new piece of music. Repeated listenings reveal things unnoticed the first time around. In addition, different conductors usually point out different aspects of the piece.\n\nThen, if you read the program notes, you become more deeply aware of the piece's depth and breadth (or lack thereof).\n\nBut when some insightful scholar stands before you and tells you just where to look for that gleaming seam of quartz behind the moss, you can have an experience much like that of the cave explorers as the guide steps forth and clicks on his flashlight.\n\nThat's what San Francisco Symphony general manager Brent Assink and his cohorts plan for their audiences, both old-timers and first-timers, with the symphony's new \"Friday 6.5\" series, slated to premiere at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 11. Assink and company will, so to speak, provide a guide with a flashlight to shine into the classical-music cave.\n\n\"Since some people might feel themselves under-equipped to really understand a classical concert, we wanted show them a way in,\" Assink said during a recent telephone chat. \"This series will provide a highly interactive format to accomplish this.\"\n\n*\n\nAnother rationale for the new series is that a number of audience members have said they would like an earlier start time than the usual 8 p.m. A 6:30 beginning allows patrons time for a leisurely Friday evening dinner following the concert, and is also attractive to young professionals and others working in the city as something appealing to do before heading home for the weekend.\n\n\"The fact that the six-concert series is already 75 percent sold out is an indication that we're responding to a definite audience need,\" Assink says.\n\nThe early evening's format seems to me a real winner. Each event will last about two hours and will focus on one large, or several smaller, works of music taken from the week's subscription concerts. The first hour will feature an informative, carefully crafted talk, illustrated with relevant musical examples involving the whole or part of the orchestra, and any chorus or soloists needed. The content will be geared to get right at the heart of the work and at the composer's related thoughts and ideas.\n\n\"The featured conductors,\" Assink elaborates, \"have been specifically chosen for their communicative skills. All of them ' Michael Tilson Thomas, Alan Gilbert, Martin Haselbock, Edwin Outwater, James Conlon and David Robertson ' are gifted communicators who know how to connect with audiences.\"\n\nAfter an intermission, the work discussed in the first hour will be performed in its entirety.\n\nThe first event, at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 11, will feature Robertson as commentator/guide and conductor of Carl Orff's sensually beautiful, thrill-a-minute Carmina Burana*, a 20th-century work based upon secular medieval sources.\n\nFeatured artists include the San Francisco Symphony and Chorus, the Pacific Boy Choir, the San Francisco Girls' Chorus, soprano Patricia Petibon, tenor Richard Troxell and baritone Christopher Maltman.\n\nAlthough California-born, Maestro Robertson was educated at London's Royal Academy of Music, where he studied French horn and composition before turning to orchestral conducting.\n\nDuring his ensuing tenure as music director of the Ensemble Intercontemporain in Paris in 1992, he gained international acclaim for his exceptional affinity with contemporary music, without sacrificing his skills with the more standard classical repertory. His most recent highly praised local appearance was as SFS guest conductor last May. He is presently in his first season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony.\n\nOther concerts in the \"Friday 6.5\" series will be Tilson Thomas conducting Stravinsky's *Petrushka*\" and Rimsky-Korsakov's *Dubinushka* on Jan. 27; Gilbert, with pianist Shai Wosner, explaining and performing Schumann's *Piano Concerto* and Richard Strauss' *Death and Transfiguration* on Feb. 24; Haselbock conducting Mozart's *Coronation Mass* and Haydn's *Storm* and *Miracle* symphonies March 10; Outwater conducting, with chansonnier H.K. Gruber and harpist Douglas Rioth performing Gruber's cabaret, *Frankenstein!!* and Debussy's *Danses Sacree et Profane* May 12; and Conlon conducting Liszt's *Dante Symphony* on June 23.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### Cheryl North Interviews Emanuel Ax**about the Szymanowski *Symphony No. 4 for Piano and Orchestra***\n\n*Material from the Classical Music Column for the October 10, 2008 Preview Section, Bay Area News Group*\n\nLocal lovers of the piano, that most versatile of musical instruments, can enjoy a bit of heaven this month, as the San Francisco Symphony presents four of the world's greatest living masters of this consummate king of keyboards.\n\n The first of these four pianists is Emanuel Ax, currently in the midst of three performances of Richard Strauss' bombastic, yet ravishingly beautiful, *Burleske* for Piano and Orchestra, composed in 1886, and the first-ever San Francisco Symphony performance of Polish composer Karol Szymanowski's exceedingly difficult Symphony No. 4 for Piano and Orchestra.\n\n According to SFS publicists, Ax is one of only two pianists who have undertaken this latter work.\n\n Toronto Symphony Music Director Peter Oundjian will serve as guest conductor. Other works on the program will be Mozart's Overture to his opera, *The Magic Flute*; and Tchaikovsky's Op. 32 *Francesca di Rimini*.\n\n Early last week I had an opportunity to speak with the congenially accessible Emanuel Ax via telephone from his Cleveland hotel prior to a performance with the Cleveland Orchestra.\n\n Ax, who is now among the most celebrated of modern pianists, was born in 1949 in Lvov, Ukraine. His parents, Joachim and Helen Ax, were both Nazi concentration camp survivors. Father Joachim began teaching young Emanuel piano at the age of six.\n\n After living for a couple of years in Warsaw, the family immigrated to Winnipeg, Canada, and finally, in 1961, to New York City. The precocious Emanuel was admitted to the Juilliard School where he continued his piano study with Mieczyslaw Munz. But young Ax extended his interests beyond music, and while continuing his Juilliard studies, went on to earn a degree in French from Columbia University. In 1970, he became an American citizen.\n\n In subsequent years he won the first Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Tel Aviv, the Avery Fisher Prize, and seven Grammy awards. A musicians' musician, Ax's performing repertoire ranges from Haydn to contemporary times and he often has performed chamber works with his pianist wife Yoko Nozaki, Yo-Yo Ma, Jaime Laredo, Yefim Bronfman, Pablo Ziegler, the late Isaac Stern, and many more.\n\n When I asked what attracted him to the music of Szymanowski, he replied, 'It offered me a chance to do something different. Szymanowski (pronounced 'She-man-OFF-ski') definitely has his own distinctive voice.'\n\n Explaining that Szymanowski dedicated his 1932 *Symphony No. 4 for Piano and Orchestra* to Arthur Rubenstein, he noted that it features some piano writing similar to Chopin's, and even has a Mazurka-like segment.\n\n 'Yet,' he said, 'it also has some of the astringency of Prokofiev and is very 20th century. Even though it's technically difficult to play, it is certainly NOT difficult to listen to,' he said.\n\n And with what must have surely been accompanied by a playful smile, he added, 'The only really difficult thing about Szymanowski's music is how to spell his name.'\n\n About classical and concert music in general, he counseled, 'I hope audiences will not worry about knowing so much about such music, but will just enjoy listening. After all, music really is meant to be enjoyed!'\n\n",

Bach's Legendary Music*\n\nOne of the nicer coincidences in this world is that the first day of spring coincides with the birthday of Johann Sebastian Bach. The great man, considered by the vast majority of accomplished classical musicians and tens of thousands of ordinary folk, to be the greatest composer of all time, was born on March 21, 1685, in Eisenach, Germany.\n\n Few other composers in the world have been either as prolific or as profound as the amazing Bach. According to several music historians, it took the Bach Gesellschaft group of scholars 46 years to gather and publish into 60 huge volumes what we now have of Bach's music. But if a copyist were to write out all this music as Bach did himself, experts estimate that it would take said copyist 70 years.\n\n When asked to describe and evaluate the quality of Bach's music, most writers and musicians tend to lapse into superlatives. Even the egotistical, irascible Richard Wagner wrote that Bach was \"the most stupendous miracle in all music.\"\n\n But perhaps most notable of all is the fact that modest old Bach's music is so mind-bogglingly good that it can be captivating whether played on a pennywhistle, steel drums, harpsichord, a mighty organ or an entire orchestra with full chorus.\n\n Fortunately for us, a couple of occasions scheduled in the Bay Area this week will bring a little musical springtime into our lives with Bach's music.\n\n The first of these, already in progress, is the current set of San Francisco Symphony concerts at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco and at Flint Center in Cupertino.\n\n The unusual aspect of these concerts is that they will be conducted not by Maestro Tilson Thomas but by the symphony's illustrious concertmaster, Alexander Barantschik.\n\n The program will feature Barantschik as violin soloist, first-chair violinist and conductor in two of Bach's loveliest works: his *Brandenburg Concerto No. 2*, with Barantschik and flutist Timothy Day, oboist William Bennett and trumpet William M. Williams Jr. all playing solos. The second Bach selection will be the *Concerto for Violin and Oboe*, with Barantschik and Bennett once again as soloists.\n\n Another magnetic attraction will be the instrument that Barantschik will play during the concerts — the famous 1742 \"David\" Guarnerius del Gesu violin, famed for its rich, almost viola-like tone. This is the same instrument once played by the late Jascha Heifitz.\n\n Other works will be Mozart's *Divertimento in F Major*, Shostakovich's *Octet*, followed by Britten's *Simple Symphony*; and two Tangos by Astor Piazzolla arranged for violin and orchestra by Oakland-based jazz violinist and tango specialist [Jeremy Cohen](c_cohenjeremy.htm).\n\n Barantschik was born in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), Russia, in the dismal year 1953, when Russia was under the repressive Soviet regime. Since 2001, he has been happily ensconced in a lovely San Mateo house with a garden containing a treasured lemon tree. With him are his musician wife, Alena, and their 9-year-old son, Benjamin, also musical.\n\n There are two more concerts remaining in the series of four. The first is at 8 tonight in Davies Symphony Hall, 201 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco. The second is at 8 p.m. Saturday in Flint Center on the DeAnza College campus in Cupertino.\n\n*San Francisco Examiner, February 13, under title: Alexander Barantschik Conducts San Francisco Symphony in Concerts This Week*\n\n The San Francisco Symphony's versatile concertmaster, Alexander Barantschik, will move from his usual role as the orchestra's first officer to act as its commander-in-chief during concerts this week at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco and Flint Center in Cupertino.\n\n Barantschik, a native of St. Petersberg, Russia, was appointed to the position of San Francisco Symphony's concertmaster in 2001. His job description usually limits him to the task of being the leader of the first violin section of the orchestra and requires him to precede the conductor on stage, bow and accept audience applause on behalf of the already-seated colleague musicians, and to be responsible for tuning the orchestra. In addition, he is expected to perform any violin solo written into the evening's orchestral works and to make decisions regarding uniform bowing among the string players.\n\n But SF music director Michael Tilson Thomas has given Barantschik's extensive musical skills a much wider berth. During this week's concerts, Barantschik will be featured as soloist, concertmaster, and conductor in a wonderfully varied program spanning music of four centuries. Moreover, he will play on the famed 1742 \"David\" Guarnerius del Gesu violin, noted for its rich, almost viola-like, tone. This is the same instrument once played by the late Jascha Heifitz.\n\n The music programmed is J.S. Bach's glorious *Brandenburg Concerto No. 2*, with violinist Barantschik, flutist, Timothy Day; oboist, William Bennett; and trumpet, William M. Williams Jr., all playing solos. Next will be Mozart's *Divertimento in F Major*, followed by Bach's *Concerto for Violin and Oboe*, with Barantschik and Bennett once again as soloists.\n\n The second half will begin with Shostakovich's *Octet*, followed by Britten's *Simple Symphony*; and two Tangos by Astor Piazzolla arranged for violin and orchestra by Oakland-based jazz violinist and tango specialist Jeremy Cohen.\n\n During a phone conversation Sunday, Barantschik explained, \"I wanted to have two distinct halves to the program -- the first is cheerful, optimistic music which is clearly articulated, transparent, and played with very little vibrato.\"\n\n \"The second half,\" he continued, \"will be darker, more dramatic and emotional, and will be played with lots of vibrato.\"\n\n The Shostakovich piece is one of his earlier works and betrays the composer's bitterness with the mounting artistic difficulties under the Soviet regime. \"It is filled with swoops and shouts,\" said Barantschik.\n\n He described the Britten *Simple Symphony*, as sharing similarities with Prokofiev's witty *Classical Symphony*, and noted that it is made up of melodies that Britten claimed to have written between the ages of nine and 12.\n\n The Piazzolla pieces, on the other hand, the congenial concertmaster-cum-conductor described, as being full of \"dark, melancholy blues\" and \"juicy reds.\"\n\n*\n\nConcertmaster Barantschik and Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas at San Francisco Symphony Concert in Cologne, Germany\n\nANG Newsapers, Preview Section, Setember 6, 2002*\n\nBack in 1979, when aspiring violinist Alexander Barantschik played through his first audition outside the Soviet Union, he did so on a banged-up, borrowed instrument. The performance won him the post of concertmaster with Germany's esteemed Bamberg Symphony Orchestra.\n\n Now, 23 years later, he strolled onstage to his concertmaster's seat in front of the San Francisco Symphony musicians and the glittering 2002-2003 opening night audience assembled last Wednesday. And, once again, he carried an old violin.\n\n However, this time around, the instrument was not banged up, but rather, one of the finest, rarest violins in the world -- the 1742 \"David\" Guarnerius del Gesu. This particular multi-million dollar violin was one of the coveted masterpieces of Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri, the most illustrious member of the violin-making Guarneri family of Cremona Italy. It was named after Ferdinand David, the violinist who owned it in the mid-19th century and for whom composer Felix Mendelssohn wrote his legendary violin concerto.\n\n The famous fiddle was purchased by the great Jascha Heifetz in 1922 and became his favorite instrument. He willed it to the San Francisco Fine Arts Museums, with the stipulation that it be played only by ``worthy performers.'' Following his death in 1987, Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, Stuart Canin, and Barantschik are among the very few worthy performers who have been fortunate enough to pass bows over its venerable strings.\n\n During a recent chat, I asked Barantschik if he would try to summon up some words to describe the \"David\" and how he would contrast its timbre with that of a Stradivarius violin. (Antonio Stradivari, who lived from 1644 to 1737, is the other equally acclaimed Cremona violin-maker).\n\n He noted that the David is in wonderful condition, looks very beautiful, and has much of its original varnish still intact.\n\n Then, after a good-natured sigh, and an admonishment that it is indeed difficult to characterize tonal quality in mere words, he tried to explain.\n\n \"I was trying a Stradivarius for almost three months last year. It was a very late one, finished in 1737, the year Antonio died. It was a beautiful instrument, but with quite a different sound from the Guarneri.\"\n\n \"Let me use some comparisons to the world of the Cinema,\" he earnestly continued in Russian-accented English. \"Imagine someone like, say, Gwynneth Paltrow. She is like the Strad. The Guarneri is more like Claudia Cardinale.\"\n\n \"The Strad has a brightness, a pristine clarity. It seems to feature more treble (high) frequencies. A Guarneri, on the other hand, has a very rich lower register and can sound rich and dark, almost like a viola. It has a very strong, dramatic tone. Whereas the Strad sound a little cool and northern, the Guarneri is hot and southern.\"\n\n I asked him if a layman could tell the difference between the two if he were to play each in succession.\n\n \"I think so,\" he replied. \"Of course, you need to play each differently to enhance its song qualities and this can change your attitude to the particular piece you are playing. You could certainly tell that they were both great instruments. But, even so, the way each sounds still rests mostly in the hands and skills of the violinist doing the playing.\"\n\n But, after a few seconds, he further qualified his statements with, \"Great instruments can help artists a lot -- playing one can be inspiring. Some technical things can certainly be affected by a poor instrument, but you can still hear real talent through it all.\"\n\n Barantschik, affectionately called \"Sasha\" by his friends and colleagues, is certainly among the worthiest of the number chosen to play the \"David\" Guarneri. Born in 1953 in Leningrad in the former Soviet Union, his youth was difficult and austere. His childhood home was in one of the scores of cell-like apartments crowded into rows of cold concrete/cinderblock high-rise boxes jutting like weeds in the Leningrad skyline.\n\n According to Barantschik, the best part about his particular building was that it just happened to be right across the street from a fine music school. Although neither his mother nor father were particularly musical, both sensed their only child's profound musical ability and had him studying violin in the nearby school before he was six years old.\n\n \"Music became one of the ways for me to escape from this grim world,\" he reminisced. \"I felt that my life would be wonderful if I could someday play with a real orchestra.\"\n\n Ultimately admitted to the prestigious Moscow Conservatory of Music, he auditioned and was accepted as a student by the revered David Oistrakh. However, since Oistrakh died the following year while conducting in Amsterdam, Barantschik perfected his prodigious technical skills and musicianship with Michael Waiman, a splendid teacher hidden away from the Western world behind the Iron Curtain.\n\n By the time he was 20, he finally had the opportunity to realize his youthful dream and played with the Leningrad Philharmonic and a number of other major musical ensembles in the Soviet Union. Then, in 1979, during a temporary thaw in cold war, Sasha and his mother left the Soviet Union for good and his life as one of the premiere violinists in the Western World began. (His father had passed away when he was 13).\n\n Now happily ensconced in a home with a garden in San Mateo with his violinist wife Alena, Benjamin, their four-year-old son, and his mother, Sasha is happy to call the San Francisco Bay Area his home -- and to be privy to playing the prized Guarneri as the concertmaster of the San Francisco Symphony.\n\n When asked what the high point of his first year as San Francisco's concertmaster, he replied with nary a pause, \"The first concert we played after September 11th (Mahler's Symphony No. 6, on Sept. 12, 2001). It was the most deeply touching event of my life ... there was a feeling of such unity ... we were all making that music and those feelings together -- the Maestro, Michael Tilson Thomas, the musicians, and the audience. That day and that concert I will always remember -- even though I was playing my old violin.\"\n\n*\n\nAlexander Barantschik and his 1742 \"David\" Guarnerius del Gesu violin\n\nANG Newspapers, Preview Section, September 7, 2001*\n\nOne of the many things Alexander Barantschik likes best about his new job is the fact that he can dash out into the backyard of his current Peninsula home and pick a fresh lemon for his tea. Barantchik, the new Concertmaster for the San Francisco Symphony, was born in the city of Leningrad in the former Soviet Union in 1953 - a time and a place in which fresh lemons, as well as a lot of other things, were scarce.\n\n Already familiarly referred to as \"Sasha,\" by his Symphony colleagues, he, his violinist wife Alena, their three-year-old son Benjamin, and his mother, are delighted to be able to call the San Francisco Bay Area home after spending so much of their lives in cold northern climes.\n\n \"San Francisco is one of the most beautiful places in the world,\" said Barantschik during an interview last week. \"My family and I are very happy to be in a place with such warmth and hospitality.\"\n\n Tanned and fit, the amiable Barantschik looks more like a ski instructor than the accomplished concertmaster of some of the world's greatest orchestras. And indeed, skiing, biking, swimming and roller-blading, along with art and architecture, are among his passions. These pursuits, however, were not available to him during his austere youth.\n\n His childhood home was in one of the scores of minimal cell-like apartments crowded into a forest of identical concrete/cinder block high rise boxes jutting like weeds through the Leningrad skyline. The best part about his particular building was that it stood right across the street from a music school. Although neither Sasha's mother nor father was particularly musical, they sensed their only child's musical ability.\n\n Barantschik remembers being deeply moved by a performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony by the Leningrad Philharmonic even before he was six years old, the age at which his parents started him on violin study and enrolled him in the nearby music school.\n\n \"Music became one of the ways for me to escape from the grim world around me,\" he reminisced. \"I felt that my life would be wonderful if I could someday play Tchaikovsky's Fifth with an orchestra.\"\n\n The competition at the music school was fierce. \"We always felt like we were on a kind of probation, since we had to re-audition every year,\" he said. \"We were taught to work very hard, and I did not have as much free time as other children my age.\"\n\n Music however, worked its magic on him and he progressed rapidly and was ultimately admitted to the prestigious Moscow Conservatory of Music. He auditioned and was accepted as a student by the legendary David Oistrakh. Oistrakh, however, died the following year while conducting in Amsterdam, so Barantschik perfected his prodigious technical skills and musicianship with Michael Waiman, a splendid teacher hidden away from the Western world behind the Iron Curtain.\n\n By the time he was 20, he finally had the opportunity to realize his youthful dream -- to play the Tchaikovsky Fifth, as well as scores of other musical master works, with the Leningrad Philharmonic and a number of other major musical ensembles in the Soviet Union. Hoping to broaden his horizons, Sasha and his mother (his father had passed away when he was 13) left the Soviet Union in 1979 during a temporary thaw in the Cold War. They headed for Vienna. Soviet authorities did not allow him to take his violin, bow, or much money out of the country. Nevertheless, he soon landed an audition with the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra in Germany. He was given the job of concertmaster, even though he had had only a banged-up borrowed violin to play for his audition!\n\n He was soon acclaimed throughout Europe and in 1982, was named to the concertmaster position of the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, and in 1989, to the same position with the London Symphony Orchestra. He distinguished himself as a concertmaster, soloist, chamber musician and performed with such musical masters as Mstislav Rostropovich, Yuri Bashmet, Maxim Vengerov, Andre Previn, Seiji Ozawa, Sir Georg Solti, Kent Nagano, Claudio Abbado, Pierre Boulez, and many more. It was during his London Symphony tenure that he met Michael Tilson Thomas, then the LSO's principal conductor.\n\n \"I formed a very special relationship with Michael,\" he said. \"When he conducts, the audience and the orchestra can sense the love of what he's doing. It's a wonderful kind of musical sharing that I too believe in and try to do, either from the concertmaster's chair or when I conduct an orchestra myself.\"\n\n \"A performance needs to have LIFE,\" he stressed. \"I hope to be not only on stage and play my violin, but to be in a real contact with the audience. When it happens, you can feel it immediately. It's like an electricity that goes from heart to heart.\"\n\n And, certainly, Sasha's ability to communicate -- either via violin, his slightly accented, but fluent English, his penetrating eyes, or his expressive body language -- is remarkable. Whether in a one-to-one verbal exchange or before a legion of musicians and a vast audience, he manages to transmit a compelling intensity.\n\n He recounted a colorful incident that occurred when he was serving as Concertmaster for a London Philharmonic performance under the baton of the late Leonard Bernstein at Suntory Hall in Tokyo.\n\n \"It was a tremendous performance, with Bernstein at his best. The audience was huge and even the Emperor of Japan was there,\" Barantschik remembered. \"The clapping just went on and on after its close. Bernstein came back for repeated bows, and with his usual intensity, motioned for various orchestra members to bow along with him. After a while, he leaned down to me and gasped that he was exhausted and told me to get the orchestra off the stage.\"\n\n \"After what Bernstein hoped was his final exit, I looked up towards the Emperor's box, and saw why the standing audience was so unusually persistent. The Emperor himself was still standing and clapping -- and no one else would leave until he did.\"\n\n \"I eventually caught his eye and made a hand motion toward the wings that I hoped would signal `That's enough!'\" Barantschik continued. \"He immediately understood, smiled at me, and made his exit. The audience instantly stopped clapping. It was as though someone had switched a radio off.\"\n\n \"Afterwards, the Emperor and his entourage came backstage to greet the Maestro and members of the Orchestra. One of the security men came up to me and whispered, `You are a very brave man!'\" Barantschik said.\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### Cheryl North Interviews Mikhail Baryshnikov**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - March 17, 2006*, under headline, More honors for the amazing Mikhail Baryshnikov**\n\nFICTION can seldom outdo the surprises, ironies and plot twists of real life.\nImagine this unlikely scenario: a member of the military of the former Soviet Union and his wife are stationed in Riga ' the erstwhile capital city of freedom-loving Latvia, the cold, birch-forested country bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\nIn 1948, this Russian-born couple have a son who will someday be awarded The National Medal of Honor of the United States of America.\n\nFiction? No ' fact.\n\n![](/images/thm-baryshnikov.jpg)\n\nBut that's only a part of the fantastic tale. This child, whom his parents named Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov, would also grow up to become a recipient of a coveted Kennedy Center Honor, a Commonwealth Award, a Chubb Fellowship and the Jerome Robbins Award. He would eventually become a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nMoreover, this Latvian-born and educated Russian would someday become a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet and then, at age 32, progress to the post of artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre.\n\nHe would father a daughter with two-time Academy Award-winning actress Jessica Lange and eventually settle in a home on the Hudson River with former American Ballet Theater dancer Lisa Rinehart and their three children. He would also be nominated for several Academy Awards for his own forays into acting.\n\nHe has been lauded by critics as \"the world's most perfect male dancer.\"\n\nAnd now, like frosting on the cake, this remarkable Riga-born Russian will be presented with the Marcus Prize for Lifetime Achievement by the San Francisco State University-sponsored International Center for the Arts at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater.\n\nIn addition to the award ceremony, there will be a performance by one of Baryshnikov's favorite ensembles, the Kremerata Baltica.\n\nIn his early 20s, Baryshnikov won celebrity status in the former Soviet Union with his brilliant dancing and musical skills. But while on tour with the famed Kirov Ballet in 1974, he defected to the West. He explained at the time that his reasons for defection had as much to do with aesthetics as political ideology. Besides being born with an uncommonly strong, muscular body, a keen sense of balance, and an innate musicality, he had a voracious desire to expand his horizons and to explore new dance, musical and artistic styles.\n\nSince defecting to America he has indeed made much of his new-found freedom by embracing a whole new hemisphere of styles. He has danced the classic ballets of Adam and Tchaikovsky, as well as Shostakovich and Glass. He has moved and grooved to the music of Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra and jazz.\n\nHe heads the White Oak Dance Project and the Baryshnikov Foundation, which encourages artists and musicians from a broad spectrum of disciplines.\n\nDuring a telephone interview earlier this week, I asked him why he has chosen the Kremerata Baltica, an ensemble made\nup of 27 twentysomething musicians from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as partner in the upcoming San Francisco event.\n\n\"Ah ' the group's founder, violinist Gidon Kremer, is an old friend of mine,\" replied\nBaryshnikov in rapid, energetic English marked with only the slightest foreign-sounding accent. \"We both went to the same conservatory in Riga.\"\n\nContinuing at the same staccato pace, he said, \"It was a remarkable school. Not only Kremer, one of the world's greatest violinists, but Mischa Meisky, one of the best cellists of our generation, and violinist Philip Hirschhorn went to the same school. We studied math, literature and all that (the basic education subjects) together, and then had separate classes and lessons in our various musical fields. Gidon was a year ahead of me, but we've remained friends all these years and he is now on the advisory board of my Baryshnikov Foundation.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that he felt the Baltic countries have a great musical and artistic tradition to share with our modern world, noting such fresh, and now influential, composers as Arvo Part of Estonia, Peter Vasks of Latvia and others from Lithuania.\n\n\"The Baltics have a special artistic point of view,\" he emphasized. \"Historically they are strong musically. (Arvo) Part put Estonia on the map, while Riga has one of the world's best historic organs in its great cathedral, and the area has a world-renowned choral tradition.\"\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Leon\nBates**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for April 5, 2002*\n\nAnyone who says that Kindergarten teachers don't have much impact on a child's life would have a bit of an argument with star pianist Leon Bates. According to Bates, it was his Kindergarten teacher in the Philadelphia Public School system, who initially inspired his love and interest in music.\n\nBates' upcoming performances of Gershwin's *Concerto in F* at 3 p.m. Sunday and 8 p.m. Tuesday with the Napa Symphony, followed by a Four Seasons Concerts recital with the Borealis Wind Quintet in Oakland at 7:30 p.m. April 13, will illustrate just how important that particular Kindergarten teacher was to the world of music.\n\n![](/images/thm-bates.jpg)\n\n\"She played a lot of music for us in our class, both on the piano and on a record player,\" said Bates during a telephone interview last week. \"There was a big old upright (piano) in our classroom and she would let us come up, one-by-one, and play on it. When it was my turn, I really got excited and would plink away as long as she would let me. She made me sensitive about what the piano could do. And -- it was in her class that I first heard Rachmaninoff.\" (Bates is now acclaimed as a major interpreter of the music of Rachmaninoff).\n\nAs an adult, Bates is admired for both his dazzling pianism and his advocacy for youth music education. He has been praised for his \"extraordinary way of inspiring, motivating and delighting America's youth\" and for \"opening their minds and hearts to the love of music.\"\n\nInspired by his Kindergarten teacher, he began nagging his mom and dad until they found a teacher for him. By the age of six, he was taking both piano and violin lessons -- and making rapid progress.\n\n\"Although my parents weren't professional musicians, I heard music in my home as far back as I can remember. And it was ALL kinds of music -- Gospel, classical, pop, blues, and jazz,\" he explained in his deep, sonorous bass-baritone voice. \"And best of all, they appreciated that it was important educationally for me to have musical training.\"\n\nAnd, there was indeed a lot of good musical training available in the Philadelphia public schools during Bates' childhood in the 1950s. He recalled that there was both a school band and an orchestra as well as a choir, from his elementary school years on through his high school graduation. He accompanied and sang in the choir, played the tuba in the band, and performed piano solos with the orchestra. During high school, he had a rock and jazz combo as well.\n\n\"One of the best parts about our school music was that our programs were performed during school assemblies for all the other kids. We were a regular part of the school life. We were never ostracized as odd, because we had almost as much exposure to our friends as our school's athletes did,\" he said.\n\nHe maintained that these school assemblies were just as important to the non-musical kids as to the musical participants. \"If my friends heard me play something by the Beatles or by Ramsey Lewis, they'd be much more interested when we played something by Beethoven -- and now, as adults, they're much more likely to buy tickets to concerts and cultural events.\"\n\nBates, who was as interested in athletics as music when he was in school, now devotes much time to weight lifting and physical fitness training.\n\n\"There's something esthetic about body-building,\" he said. \"It's easy to transfer my thoughts from music to weight-training. Both take tremendous discipline and strong powers of concentration. You have to learn to weed out distractions when you are lifting, just as you do when you are practicing piano or performing in a concert. One reinforces the other. Besides, I'm sure that my fitness has helped me play Rachmaninoff better,\" he quipped.\n\n![](/images/leon-bates.jpg)\n\nWhile it's quite remarkable for a concert pianist to be a high-achieving weight-lifter, it's perhaps even more remarkable for one to have been given the Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award in New York City. Bates was honored with this important award in 1993 for his extensive work with children and music education. Besides a packed concert schedule that takes him throughout the world, he finds time to teach the young during 50 or more residencies in conjunction with his orchestral engagements and recitals in various U.S. cities each year. Because of these endeavors, he has also been awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.\n\nKnown world-wide for both his sensitivity and his prowess as a pianist, Bates' prodigious repertoire includes all the Rachmaninoff and Beethoven Piano Concerti, most of Mozart's, as well as major works by Liszt, Chopin, Bartok, Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Ravel, and Poulenc. He has performed with the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony, the Philadelphia and Cleveland Orchestras and at Carnegie Hall, Hollywood Bowl, Kennedy Center and more.\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews John Bayless**\n\n*Classical Music Column for the November 3, 2006 ANG PREVIEW Section*\n\nImprovisation, in the minds of most of today's classical music mavens, is usually limited to jazz venues, piano bars, or someone's living room.\n\n This is to say, that if any unfamiliar or not-written-in-the-original-score notes are played-- or if one of the written-in notes doesn't get played ' there's something wrong with the performance. Critics criticize and audiences grimace. If such faux pas were to be made by such performers as violinist Joshua Bell, pianists Richard Goode or Evgeny Kissin, or any number of other major classical artists, we would be shocked.\n\n But this hasn't always been the case.\n\n Back in the 18th century, people were downright thrilled to hear J.S. Bach introduce a simple hymn tune on the organ, only to follow its first iteration with five to 20 minutes of improvisations that often taxed the organ to its utmost capacity and dazzled admiring members of the congregation. One of Bach's several sons is even recorded to have said that his papa was at his best when improvising.\n\n When Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms came along, the musical literati were positively in love with the 'variation' form, which consisted of a composer or performer taking a given theme and then writing or playing as many 'variations' on it that he could conjure up.\n\n Franz Liszt secured his international 'matinee idol' fame by participating in a number of public competitions during which he and another virtuosic pianist staged a 'duel' to see which of them could dream up the most original, and technically dazzling improvisations of a particular theme during a concert. The outcome of the 'duel' was usually determined by audience applause ' and Liszt usually won.\n\n Except for the occasional semi-improvised cadenza in a piano concerto, this exciting, on-the-spot art form is all but lost on serious classical concert stages of today.\n\n Or is it?\n\n After a chat with pianist John Bayless, who called in from Tokyo last Saturday eve, I feel reassured that the risky art of 'classical' improvisation might just regain some of its past pizzazz. Bayless will be the soloist in Gershwin's *Rhapsody in Blue* next week during the Oakland East Bay Symphony's season-opening performance at 8 p.m. Nov. 10 at the Paramount Theatre, 2121 Broadway, in Oakland.\n\n He is known to audiences worldwide for his many recordings, including the number-one-*Billboard Magazine*-rated *The Puccini Album ' Arias for the Piano*, released about a decade ago, and more recently, for his CD's on the *Angel* label, *Romantica*, a collection that includes his improvisations on themes and arias from *Cavalleria Rusticana* and *La Wally*; *Vissi D'Arte*; *Una Furtiva Lagrima*; *Mattinata*; and more, as well as *The Movie Album ' Classical Pictures*.\n\n*\n\n 'My forte is improvisation,' he cheerily announced when I spoke to him from his Tokyo hotel on what was (for him) a bright Sunday morning across the international dateline.\n\n He seemed a person of great charm and graciousness as he proceeded to explain that he's been performing a concert entitled 'Amadeus Live' all over Japan this past month. He loves performing in Japan, a place he says, where there is much respect and courtesy and very little crime.\n\n 'They are in love with Western classical music,' he added. 'They support some 3,000 concert halls scattered throughout Japan, most of which seat 1200 to 1800 people and have Hamburg Steinway pianos.'\n\n His \"Amadeus Live\" program, he explained, has three parts, about 25 minutes each. During the first third of each concert, he dresses in 18th century Mozart-like garb, and performs favorite Mozart masterworks on the piano. Then, during the second third of the concert, he includes operatic singers to perform various of Mozart's most beloved arias with his piano accompaniment.\n\n The third 'third' is given over to pure improvisation. About a dozen folk-like Japanese songs, picked because they are familiar to almost every Japanese, are listed in the program. He asks people in the audience which on the list they would like to hear, after which he plays their choices in the style of Beethoven, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Ravel, or Gershwin.\n\n 'The audience is delighted,' Bayless said. 'They're actually participating ' and since I'm improvising, there's a freshness about it that comes out differently each time I play it.'\n\n I asked him if he planned to include a few of his own improvisatory touches in next week's Rhapsody in Blue* in Oakland.\n\n 'Oh, I've added bits here and there,' he revealed. 'I've played it every since I was a teenager ' in Aspen, Tanglewood, Hollywood Bowl, even the San Francisco Symphony during its summer concerts. My grandma used to put an old Oscar Levant recording of the *Rhapsody* on our record player and we listened to the Paul Whitman Orchestra's first recordings of it as well. It's one of the first and best fusions of the classical form with American jazz, after all ' and that makes it very appealing for improvisation.'\n\n Born in the little town of Borger, Texas (near Amarillo), Bayless told me that he has been playing the piano since he was four.\n\n 'My mom, a singer, was my first teacher. When I was a kid, I remember running up to the piano almost every Sunday after church to play ' and improvise ' on the hymns,' he said.\n\n When he was 15, he went to the Aspen School of Music, and then on to study with Adele Marcus at Juilliard where he further honed his pianistic skills.\n\n There was a daunting cloud over his youth, however. He was born with a congenital kidney problem which began to seriously threaten his life from age six on. By the time he was 20, he had had eight major operations.\n\n \"I deal with its effects almost every day ' if it wasn't for music and my faith, I wouldn't have survived,' he said. 'Fortunately, I'm very happy doing what I'm doing.'\n\n Right after his Oakland appearance, Bayless will take off for a white Christmas tour back to the heartland states of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, and South Dakota before returning to the Bay Area, where he now lives.\n\n Michael Morgan will be at the helm conducting the OEBS during the opening night concert at 8 p.m. Nov. 10 at the Paramount Theatre, 2121 Broadway, in Oakland. The concert is entitled 'Made in America,' and besides Bayless playing Gershwin's *Rhapsody in Blue*, will include Aaron Copland's wonderful *Symphony No. 3*, which includes his famous *Fanfare for the Common Man* in its final movement.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n*\n\nClassical Music Column for September 13, 2002 ANG PREVIEW Section*\n\nby Cheryl North\n\nThe rarefied world of the violin, its masters and its lovers, brims with intrigue - and uncanny coincidence.\nConsider last night at Davies Symphony Hall. Joshua Bell, the hot young head of the world's current remarkable set of youthful violin virtuosos, performed Samuel Barber's resplendent Violin Concerto with the San Francisco Symphony on his multi-million-dollar 1713 Stradivarius Violin.\n\n*\n\nBut just a few feet to his right, was another multi-million-dollar instrument of great significance to Bell. The 1742 Guarneri del Jesu violin, known as the \"David,\" was cradled in the arms of SFS Concertmaster Alexander Barantschik. Named for one of its previous owners, the great 19th century virtuoso Ferdinand David, the \"David\" was the favorite instrument of the 20th century's premier virtuoso, Jascha Heifetz.\n\nNow here's the kicker. Bell's most recent hit recording, the Op. 64 Violin Concerto in E Minor by Felix Mendelssohn with Sir Roger Norrington conducting the Camerata Salzburg, was actually inspired by the very David for whom Mendelssohn wrote the piece. In fact, it was this self-same violin under Barantschik's chin, with which David had premiered the Mendelssohn concerto in 1845.\n\nDuring a cell phone interview with Bell on Monday as he was traveling on a Los Angeles freeway to a recording studio, I told him the astonished Bell that the \"David'\" would actually be within his reach when he performed on the Davies Hall stage later in the week.\n\nI asked him why it is that old violins are so desirable.\n\n\"They sound better. Believe me, if I could spend less to get such glorious sound quality, I would,\" he replied. \"I basically mortgaged my life away to get this particular Strad.\"\n\nBell's current fiddle is not only expensive, it is fraught with mystery and intrigue. Named the \"Gibson\" for Alfred Gibson, one of its earliest owners, it was owned early in the 20th century by Polish virtuoso Bronislaw Huberman. It was stolen from him in Vienna in 1919. Although soon returned, it was stolen once again from his dressing room in New York City's Carnegie Hall in 1936 and thereafter seemed to vanish from the face of the earth. Then in 1985, in a deathbed confession, a former cafe musician named Julian Altman revealed, with convincing, although mind-boggling evidence, that his violin was really the famed \"Gibson\" Stradivarius.\n\nThe good news is that the mysterious instrument, with its red-hued varnish, is now in Bell's worthy hands. Referring to the Grammy Award winning John Corigliano soundtrack to the film The Red Violin* in which he played the violin solos, Bell told a previous interviewer, \"It's really ironic for me that I'm ending up with a red violin!\"\n\nI asked Bell if he could summon up some English words to describe the vaunted Stradivarius sound. \"It has incredible tonal quality ... it projects through a hall...it has distinctive, rich overtones...great subtlety and nuance. My first teacher, Josef Gingold, played a Strad.\"\n\nResponding to my question about how a Stradivari compares to a Guarneri, he said, \"The Guarneri is like a Lamborghini automobile - great power with 12 cylinders. The more you press it, the more it gives. The Strad, on the other hand, is more like a Porsche - finely, precisely engineered.\"\n\nBell loves fine cars almost as much as he loves violins. He drives a Porsche 911 and participated in the Indy 500 last year by playing his fiddle for the festivities after he driving his own lap around the track before the 350,000 assembled fans.\nIn spite of his celebrity status and his being named one \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" by *People Magazine* and one of Glamour Magazine's \"Six 'It' Men of the Millennium,\" Bell continues to be thoughtful and unaffected in his dealings with friends, fans, the press, and the general public.\n\nBorn in Bloomington, Indiana in 1967 and had a relatively normal childhood with his psychologist parents and two sisters. He grew up loving computer games and played basketball competitively. He made the finals of a national tennis tournament when he was 10. Yet, by age 14, violin in hand, he made his highly acclaimed orchestral debut with Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Within months, he performed his Carnegie Hall debut.\n\nNow a world-class musical superstar, he has performed to great acclaim with the world's major orchestras and conductors. In addition to two best-selling movie score recordings, he has made highly praised CDs of Leonard Bernsteins' *West Side Story Suite*; won a Grammy Award for his CD performance of Nicholas Maw's new *Violin Concerto*; and earned raves for his participation in the lively blue-grass recording *Short Trip Home* with Edgar Meyer as well as an interesting crossover disc, *Perpetual Motion*, with Bela Fleck.\n\nBell champions of music of all kinds. His feelings are especially strong about the Barber *Violin Concerto* he's currently performing with the SFS. \"When Barber wrote it in the 1940s, it was not taken seriously because it was not in what was then 'mainstream.' It was tonal and lyrical, instead of 12-tone atonal. It was considered to be pedestrian, even a little vulgar,\" he explained. \"But I sincerely consider it to be the American violin concerto. It's one of my favorites,\" he maintained.\n\nBut, one can't spend hour upon hour in musical communication with Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, Mozart, and Sibelius and the like, and not be deeply committed to his fellow men. Often a performer on benefit programs throughout the world, Bell rallied friends together for an impromptu performance at a Red Cross shelter after witnessing the infamous 9/11 attack from his loft in New York City. Last Wednesday, on the attack's one-year anniversary, Bell participated with Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the SFS in a free outdoor concert in Yerba Buena Gardens.\n\nHe is also a champion of youth musical education and has made guest appearances on *Sesame Street* and a number of other educational television shows. As an adjunct professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he is seriously involved working on the development of a new electronic instrument, a so-called \"Hyperviolin,\" geared to spur creativity and help kids learn music.\n\nAnd how does this young, uncommonly handsome, intense, young violinist want to be considered 25 years from now?\nCasting all the glamour and celebrity aside, he said, \"I want to be appreciated by my peers -- to be considered a musicians' musician.\"\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Olga Borodina**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for Preview Section, September 15, 2000*\n\nThe Russians are coming; the Russians are coming! The old Cold War chills have escalated into a red hot invasion of Russian musicians into the Bay Area. While this column's opening phrase was the title of a Hollywood movie a few years back, it also fits what's happening on local stages this season.\n\nWhile the well-nigh legendary Valery Gergiev led his musical minions from the Kirov Orchestra and compatriot pianist Alexander Toradze through an occupation of the Zellerbach Auditorium stage on the University of California campus in Berkeley last night, a whole pack of Russians -- Olga Borodina, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Anna Netrebko, Nikolai Gassiev, Irina Bogachova, Elena Bocharova, and Vladimir Ognovenko -- are in the process of transforming San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House stage into a bastion of Ivan the Terrible's Russia for a number of nights this month.\n\nIn addition, Maxim Vengerov, the critically acclaimed young Russian violinist, will leave his musical mark on the Davies Hall stage when he performs with Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony for the season's opening night Gala at 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nOnly four days later, at 8 p.m. September 24, the reigning Czar of Concert Pianists, Evgeny Kissin, will stride alone onto Davies stage to conquer the crowds attending San Francisco Performances' opening night.\n\nWhat is it about these vaunted Russians, anyway?\n\n*\n\nI had an opportunity to talk to one of them, mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, last Thursday during a brief meeting in the press room of the San Francisco Opera house just before she was to rehearse her number for the following night's Lotfi Mansouri Gala. Borodina, a leading artist with the Kirov Opera, has a lovely face that could easily fit into a Romantic Gainsborough or George Romney portrait. Her speaking voice has a sultry timbre, which because of her heavy Russian accent, seems deepened to an even duskier hue. Not quite confident enough to go through with an interview in English, the thirty-something mezzo brought along a very affable translator, the Odessa-born (Russia) San Francisco Opera accompanist, Susanna Lemberskaya.\n\nAlthough Borodina's initial seriousness permitted her only the most formal smile when we were introduced, she warmed when speaking about her family and her art. In fact, her smile became quite radiant when she told me about her two sons - a 14-year-old named Alexi who is in school in St. Petersburg and whom she considers to be quite musical, and little Maxim, her 28-month-old who travels with her everywhere she goes.\n\nBorodina herself was born in St. Petersburg to parents who both worked in a factory building pianos. It was not until she was 12 that she began singing seriously, and this was in a children's chorus.\n\n\"I never dreamed, never even hoped, to become an opera singer,\" she said.\n\nAfter completing the equivalent of high school, she attended college. However, after only two years there, with the encouragement of teachers, she moved on to St. Petersburg's main music conservatory for what was to be a five-year-program of study.\n\n\"But in only my third year,\" she said, \"Valery Gergiev took me out of the Conservatory to sing the role of Siebel in the Kirov Opera production of Gounod's Faust.*\"\n\nHer career as an opera star was launched.\n\nAfter her Kirov debut, she went on to win a first prize gold medal in the Rosa Ponselle International Vocal Competition, as well as the 1989 Barcelona Competition, both of which brought her critical raves throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nBy 1992, after making her debut at London's Royal Opera as Dalila to Placido Domingo's Samson, her talents took her into the operatic stratosphere. She was immediately invited to sing the title role in *La Cenerentola* as well as Marguerite in *La Damnation de Faust.*\n\nHer big year in San Francisco came in 1995 when she made her local debut in *La Cenerentola*. She was asked to return the following year, which she did and then proceeded to dazzle both her audiences and the local critics with her flawless singing and sensuous interpretation of *Carmen* -- even though she was pregnant with Maxim at the time!\n\nSince then she has gone on to sing at the Salzburg Festival and the Metropolitan Opera and has triumphed in the principal mezzo roles in *Boris Godunov; The Queen of Spades; Aida; Don Carlo; Adriana Lecouvreur * (at La Scala); and *Carmen* at the Bastille in Paris.\n\nIn addition to all of the above, she has made a name as a recitalist, having performed in London, Milan, Vienna, Geneva, Hamburg, Barcelona, Madrid, Edinburgh, Rome, Paris, New York, and here in San Francisco. She has also made a number of critically acclaimed recordings and videos, including a CD of arias and duets opposite her long-standing colleague, Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.\n\nThe role of Dalila in Saint-Saens' *Samson et Dalila* is her favorite (she sang the opera's meltingly seductive \"Mon coeuer s'ouvre a ta voix\" at the Lotfi Mansouri Gala last Friday eve). She emphasized to me that she loves working with Maestro Mansouri, who besides directing her in *Tsar's Bride* directed her in her first *Carmen*.\n\nSimilarly, she is indebted to Gergiev, whom she described as \"My father.\" Then, after a flurry of words with her interpreter, she modified her comment with the words, \"He is like my Godfather.\"\n\nShe loves working in the United States, and most particularly San Francisco. \"It is much more relaxed working in the United States than in Russia,\" she says. \"And San Francisco...I love. It is so wide, so fresh, so very nice...and I have many friends here.\"\n\nSince she is noted for her dramatic ability as well as for her singing, I asked if her St. Petersburg training had emphasized acting.\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"What I do on stage is simply what I feel about the character I am singing. I never feel particularly nervous or lonely on stage because I myself am never really there. Instead, it is Dalila, Carmen, or Amneris who is on stage. I really become the person I am portraying.\"\n\nWhat does she do in her spare time?\n\n\"Fishing,\" she quickly replied.\n\nAfter I made a few arm motions of casting a line into a stream like a fly fisherman, she interjected an enthusiastic \"Yes! Like that.\"\n\nWhen asked about a role she would like to sing in the future, she replied after a few second's thought, \"Azucena (from Verdi's *Il Trovatore*). She is a REAL mother!\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Writes about Pierre Boulez**\n\n*ANG Newspapers, May 19, 2000*\n\nOne of the most difficult, even disturbing, pieces of music I've ever encountered was a duo piano work written by the great French composer Pierre Boulez. Yet, one of the nicest, most thoroughly civilized gentlemen I've ever met, was its composer, Pierre Boulez.\n\nNow, at the age of 75, Boulez is still one of the 20th century's most controversial musicians. Igor Stravinsky, before his death in 1971, called Boulez \"the greatest composer of his generation,\" and just a couple of months ago, the respected British music critic High Canning, wrote that Boulez is both \"icon and guru to the cutting-edge contemporary music set...begetter of all that is strident, difficult and inaccessible to the vast majority of classical music lovers.\"\n\nAlthough he is the acknowledged alpha composer of the avant garde, as a conductor, Maestro Boulez is arguably the most revered interpreter of the more traditional, aesthetically beautiful, works of Debussy, Stravinsky, and Mahler. His 1998 Deutsche Grammophon recording leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra through Mahler's Symphony No. 9 even won a Grammy!\n\n*\n\nSo, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players are right on the mark to finish off their 1999/2000 Concert Series with a musical tribute to the great Boulez to celebrate his 75th birthday. Scheduled for 8 p.m. Monday at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater, 700 Howard St., in San Francisco, the concert will feature Boulez' adventurous Sur Incises*, scored for three harps, three pianos, and three percussion instruments.\n\nThe Players will acknowledge yet another prominent contemporary composer -- Luciano Berio, who also celebrates his 75th birthday this year. Berio will be honored with a performance of his dream-like *Linea*, written for two pianos and two percussion instruments.\n\nMy first painful encounter with Boulez' infamous duo piano piece happened back in the early 1980s, when I was taking a contemporary music class, benevolently taught by prominent East Bay composer/scholar/professor, Glenn Glasow.\n\n\"Why,\" I thought, \"would ANYone compose something like this?\"\n\nThe piece was almost mechanically rigid. Maestro Boulez had not only dictated the specific series of angularly dissonant 12 notes to be used over and over again in the composition, he also indicated exactly how he wanted the performers to attack and release those specific notes. The nightmarish score looked and sounded like nothing I'd ever before encountered.\n\nHowever, the rather short, but sturdily built, Boulez himself was the epitome of Gallic graciousness when I met him at a benefit for the Gustav Mahler Library in Paris last Fall. He smilingly, tirelessly, greeted all those who came up to him, and quite modestly responded to the extravagant praises being heaped upon him for his brilliant interpretation of Stravinsky's *Petroushka* earlier that evening.\n\nIt seems that the versatile Boulez has a foot in both the more traditional musical world of order and tonality, and the ultra-modern, anything-goes, contemporary music scene.\n\nBorn on March 26, 1925 in Montbrison, (near Lyon) France, he studied with Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire and founded the Ensemble InterContemporain at his Paris base of the Institut de Recherche et Co-ordination Acoustique/Musique. As both composer/innovator and traditional conductor, he has been credited with having more influence on the international music scene than any other post-war figure.\n\nAccording to interviews in the spate of international magazines, newspapers, and books published about him so far this year, Boulez considers himself a \"simple man\" who hates the idea of getting up at precisely 7:30 a.m. and having lunch at 12:30 p.m. He doesn't usually eat breakfast and avoids taxis and traffic and prefers to stay in simple hotels within walking distance of the concert halls where he performs. He also admits to loving poetry and sometimes stays up until 2 or 3 a.m.\n\nHis main residence is in the center of Paris, but he also has a home in Baden Baden to which he loves to drive his Mercedes in order to spend three or four weeks alone, thinking and composing, each year. He still plays the classics on his Steinway piano, but according to him, \"not very well.\"\n\nAlthough he has enjoyed unabashed glory on the podium as a conductor and even spent his recent 75th birthday conducting the Ensemble InterContemporain in a performance of his largest orchestral work, *Pli selon pli*, in London's Southbank Centre, he intends to retire from conducting and concentrate on composition.\n\n\"There isn't enough time for everything,\" he says. \"Composing is a constant urge -- it never stops.\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Branford Marsalis**\n\n*Classical Music Column, Preview Section, Bay Area News Group, September 26, 2008*\n\nSome families seem to have an inordinate amount of genetic good luck.\n\nConsider the number of adept politicians and public servants abounding in the Adams or Kennedy family gene pools, or the bounty of extraordinary actors produced by the Barrymore and Redgrave families.\n\nFew families in history, however, have equaled the magnificent Marsalis clan of New Orleans for its proliferation of top-flight musicians — except, of course, for the Bach family back in 17th and 18th century Germany!\n\nFortunately for us, the musical moxie of Branford Marsalis, one of the more jazz-oriented members of the aforementioned dynasty, will be on display in the Bay Area next week as he opens the 2008-2009 Stanford Lively Arts season with a program called \"Marsalis Brasilianos\" at Memorial Auditorium in Palo Alto.\n\nBranford Marsalis is one of the six sons of Ellis Marsalis Jr. and his wife, Delores Ferdinand. While Branford and Delfeayo are saxophone virtuosos, Wynton is one of the world's premier trumpeters, and Jason is a master percussionist. Another son, Ellis Marsalis III, is a poet, photographer and computer-networking specialist, while the youngest, Mboya Kinyatta, is autistic.\n\nBranford generously took time out of his frenetic schedule to answer a few of my questions last week.\n\n'Intellectual challenge'\n\n To my question, \"What on earth did your parents do to raise so many high-achieving, successful musicians?\" he answered: \"I was raised to be a modern politician. My mom is a fiery, in-your-face kind of woman with strong opinions. My dad has strong opinions as well, but burns much cooler, and has the ability to see an argument from both sides of an issue — what we now call nuance.\n\n\"Ours was a house full of intellectual challenge, and a healthy dose of banality. I didn't know of any parents, other than my own, among my circle of friends who read Kahlil Gibran, W.E.B. Du Bois and the Enquirer.\"\n\nCiting more details about his early training, he said, \"I had a counterintuitive musical upbringing. Whereas most kids practice and study diligently, I did not (though I do now). But I listened to a ton of music and still do. While I am not advocating not practicing, I think all musicians would benefit greatly from more varied listening habits.\"\n\nLike brother Wynton, Branford is known for his broad musical scope. Master of all sorts of saxophones, he has already gained fame, acclaim and three Grammys for his jazz skills. He has also spent two years touring and recording with Sting and has served as musical director of *The Tonight Show* with Jay Leno. He has collaborated with the Grateful Dead and Bruce Hornsby.\n\nMoreover, Branford is also an actor of note and has appeared in a number of films, including *Throw Momma From the Train* and *School Daze*, and provided music for *Mo' Better Blues*. In addition, he served as host for National Public Radio's syndicated program *Jazz Set*. Nevertheless, he has become increasingly active as a soloist with such acclaimed symphony orchestras as Chicago, Detroit and Dusseldorf and the Boston Pops. His nearly two dozen recordings in various styles have received numerous accolades, with his most recent CD, the Grammy-nominated *Braggtown*, acknowledged as his quartet's greatest recorded achievement to date.\n\nTherefore, the Stanford program represents a bit of a departure from Branford's usual musical fare. \"Marsalis Brasilianos\" will focus on a more classical menu with its commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Brazil's great classical composer, Heitor Villa-Lobos. The concert will include not only a number of Villa-Lobos favorites, but also several of French-born composer Darius Milhaud's evocative musical meditations on Brazil.\n\nBacking Marsalis in this properly symphonic program will be the Philharmonia Brasileira Orchestra of Brazil, led by its founder and conductor, Gil Jardim.\n\nWide-ranging program\n\n Among the works planned for the program will be Villa-Lobos' 1949 *Fantasia for Soprano Saxophone and Piano or Orchestra*, his 1912 *Suite for Strings* and the exquisitely beautiful *Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5*, composed in 1938 in tribute to the 17th century music of J.S. Bach.\n\nAdditional selections will be Milhaud's 1923, Op. 81 composition *La creation du monde*, as well as his ebullient 1937 *Scaramouche for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra*.\n\nRegarding the Brazilian Villa-Lobos' significance to classical music, Marsalis said, \"When most people think of Brazilian music, they think of the samba-influenced music of the '40s, '50s and '60s, particularly the music of Jobim. Villa-Lobos is nothing like that. I think there will be a few surprised folks in the audience.\"\n\n![](/images/branford-marsalis-wc-08-1005.jpg)\n\nWarner and Cheryl North with Branford Marsalis at the reception following the opening of the Stanford Lively Arts Season on October 5, 2008\n(Photo credit: Toni Gauthier, courtesy of Stanford Lively Arts)\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Russell Braun**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column, Lifestyle Section, Thursday, December 2, 2004 *\n\nCan a genuinely dedicated family man be a major world-class opera singer?\n\n If it's baritone Russell Braun you're talking about, the answer is an emphatic yes.\n\n Perhaps it helps some that almost everyone in Braun's family is musical too. His late father was Victor Braun, one of the leading baritones of his era. His mother, Eraine Schwing-Braun not only teaches at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, she is also a language coach for the Canadian Opera Company.\n\n Braun is married to a fine musician, pianist Carolyn Maule, and their two children, seven-year-old Benjamin and three-year-old Gabriel, are already exhibiting musical tendencies. Even his younger brother plays in a rock band.\n\n \"There was always music in our home when I was a child in Cologne, Germany. Singers and musicians often gathered at our house for parties and music-making,\" said Braun during an interview he sandwiched between all-day rehearsals at the San Francisco Opera house last week.\n\n However, our interview was delayed a few minutes as Braun took a call on his cell phone.\n As he clicked his phone off, a huge grin covered his face as he explained, \"This is the time my boys usually call to say good night. It's about their bedtime in Toronto.\"\n\n The younger edition of the Braun family continues the family tradition of music making at their present home on an acre of land near Georgetown, Ontario, northwest of Toronto, Canada. Young Benjamin is about to begin piano lessons and both he and his younger brother enjoy singing.\n\n Russell himself plays the piano a great deal and is quoted in an Canadian Opera magazine article as saying, \"I love playing four-hand piano arrangements. Sometimes I sit down and play one part and then the other. Then my wife feels sorry for me, and joins me.\"\n She also accompanies him in a number of recital appearances, as well as other of their singing colleagues, such as tenor Michael Schade and his mezzo-soprano wife, Maureen.\n\n At age 39, Russell is 6'2\" tall and is built like a football player, although he swears that he has never played the game \"is not a jock.\" Instead, he loves hiking about in the snow, painting and sculpting, as well as music. He has a shock of dark curly hair, a friendly, relaxed manner, and a face that seems as though it could never frown.\n\n*\n\n \"I love Toronto's cold snowy weather,\" he said. \"Last January and February there was tons of snow on the ground at home. I went out in the thick of it and started building a huge igloo. It was around 20 degrees below zero Centigrade, but I loved it. I even went out on a midnight run to gather snow from neighboring yards for my building project,\" he said as he flashed an ever broadening smile.\n\n As a kid in Germany, he loved the rock group \"Queen,\" the Beatles, and Cat Stevens.\n During his college years at the University of Toronto, he often turned pages for the accompanists during recitals by Kiri Te Kanawa, Pinchas Zukerman, Isaac Stern, and Jesse Norman. Norman's performance of Schubert's song Der Erlkonig*, in fact so electrified him that he became one of her most devoted admirers.\n \"In 2006 I'm scheduled to sing *Dido and Aenas* with her at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris,\" he beamed. \"What a thrill.\"\n\n He noted, that in Lieder singing, \"you really have to TELL the story. You can be either deeply involved as one of the story's characters or you can be somewhat detached as an observer-narrator. Singing Lieder is always challenging.\"\n\n Braun usually sings at least 10 recitals a year in addition to his operatic roles. In fact, two nights before our interview, he had traveled up to the Napa Valley with Maestro Donald Runnicles to perform Schubert's *Die Winterreise* with Runnicles accompanying on the piano. He also loves performing songs by Hugo Wolfe (the Heyse translation of Wolfe's *Italienische Lieder*), by Schumann, and by Mahler.\n\n He explained that earlier, he had shied away from performing Mahler's *Kindertotenlieder* (Songs on the Death of Children).\n \"But then, after having my own children, I realized the importance of telling the stories involved in these songs. Now I can sing them with depth and understanding.\"\n\n He described this past year as being a \"dream year\" as far as operatic roles are concerned. \"I have been able to sing three of my dream operas -- *Pelleas et Melisande* in Hamburg; *Eugene Onegin* in San Francisco; and *The Pearl Fishers* in San Diego.\"\n\n \"But, I'm interested in singing all kinds of repertoire,\" he emphasized. He has sung the title role in *Billy Budd* at the Vienna State Opera with Donald Runnicles conducting; the role of Wolfram (who sings the beloved \"Evening Star\" aria) in Wagner's *Tannhauser*; Guglielmo in Mozart's *Cosi fan Tutte* and Gounod's *Faust* at l'Opera de Paris; and Figaro in *The Barber of Seville* at the Met.\n\n In San Francisco, Braun is currently singing the title role of Tchaikovsky's great opera *Eugene Onegin*, based on the story by Alexander Pushkin.\n While he has most often been associated with \"good,\" sympathetic characters, he says he is starting to play some \"rotten ones too -- like Enrico in *Lucia di Lammermoor.* And, I'm finding the Onegin character to be very complex and a little difficult to play sympathetically.\"\n\n But he is thoroughly enjoying working with Johannes Schaaf, the great German director.\n \"Opera, with its music, reveals far more than theater alone. Musical communication continues far beyond the words,\" Braun explained. \"As a result, Schaaf considers every move and expression we make. He will accept no excuses for opera, because he considers it the highest of all the art forms.\"\n\n The new-to-San Francisco-Onegin production is designed by Peter Pabst and lit by Manfred Voss and Andreas Frank. Israeli-born Maestro Ilan Volkov will conduct.\n Other members of the cast will be soprano Elena Prokina as the naive Tatyana; mezzo-soprano Allyson McHardy as Olga; and tenor Piotr Beczala as Lensky. It will be sung in Russian.\n\n I asked Braun how he would like to be able to summarize his career 40 or 50 years into the future.\n \"While I want to feel pride and accomplishment with my ability to make music come alive for others, I hope most of all, that my sons will still love me, and that my wife will have both love and respect for me.\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Cheryl North Interviews Keith Cerny, newly named Director of the Dallas Opera**\n\n*Classical Music Column for the April 30, Preview Section, Bay Area News Group*\n\nBy Cheryl North\n\n Opera lovers living in the\n\"Lone Star\" state of Texas ought to be thanking all their lucky stars these days for the super nova energy shining on them from the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n Not only is Berkeley-born and bred Renaissance man Keith Cerny, 47, taking up residence in Dallas, Texas as General Director of its 53-year-old opera company next month, but San Francisco-based composer Jake Heggie's promethean new opera, *Moby Dick*, will have its world premiere performance tonight (April 30) at the Dallas Opera's new 2,200-seat, state-of-the-art Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House.\n\n But there's more: Patrick Summers, one of the star graduates of the San Francisco Opera's Merola Program, will be *Moby Dick*'s conductor. Summers also lends his star power as Music Director of the Houston (Texas ) Grand Opera.\n\n Of immediate interest, is, of course, the grand opening of Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*. Its composer, Jake Heggie, is one of the most beloved and respected of contemporary musical figures, and the book, *Moby Dick* is deemed one of the greatest achievements in American literature.\n\n \"I heard music, BIG music, when writer/playwright Terrence McNally first suggested that Moby Dick would be ideal for an opera,\" Heggie confided in an e-mail exchange earlier this week. When McNally became too ill to undertake the task, composer-librettist Gene Scheer was called upon as Heggie's collaborator.\n\n In words that exude the same grace and clarity as his music, Heggie continued his e-mail with the comment, \"The story itself is of a time, but for all time ... and though it is an American story, it is truly a universal story about struggles people must confront no matter where they live or in what circumstance.\"\n\n Further, he noted,that despite its scope, the tale has \"great intimacy within immense forces ... where something is at stake every single moment. All that is terribly operatic.\"\n\n Heggie as well as Scheer were not cowed by Melville's somewhat stilted language, but rather, were inspired by it. \"Melville's combination of prose, poetry, and metered speech ... is terribly moving,\" wrote Heggie.\n\n He also described the cast as \"first rate across the boards starting with the great Ben Heppner as Captain Ahab. This man completely blows my mind: the overwhelming power of his voice and presence. He is great in the true sense of that word.\"\n\n Lest local folks despair that the production is happening in down in the heart of Texas -- since it is a joint commission -- upon its completion in Dallas, it will move on to Australia, Canada, San Diego, and finally, in 2012, to San Francisco.\n\n \"These are good times in this composer's life,\" Heggie declared.\n\n The good times are likely to continue for the Dallas Opera as well, when on May 24, Cerny takes up his duties as its General Director. During an interview last Friday, he said he is ready to begin planning Dallas's 2012-2013 Season right away - and he's certainly up to the task.\n\n From 2004 through 2007, Cerny served as Executive Director (both COO and CFO) of the San Francisco Opera where he managed the organization to three consecutive years of balanced budgets. He has worked in executive positions with McKinsey & Company, the San Francisco office of Accenture, as CEO of Sheet Music Plus, consulting with the Atlanta Opera and the Spoleto Music Festival, and has done a great deal of pro bono work as well.\n\n Cerny (originally a Czech name, pronounced Sur'ney in English) will take plenty of musical moxie to Dallas as well. At age 10, he was admitted into the San Francisco Boys Choir. Soon after, he talked his parents into buying a piano and giving him piano lessons. Precocious in many areas, he was accepted as a full-fledged student at the University of California in Berkeley at age 15.\n\n He graduated four years later as a Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors in both music and physics. Both his parents had Ph.Ds and his father was a professor of chemistry and nuclear physics at UC Berkeley.\n\n The younger Cerny's next stop was London where he studied piano accompanying and conducting. He followed that up at Harvard University where he earned an M.B.A., followed by a Ph.D. in Economic Development Studies/Econometrics in the U.K.\n\n In spite of all the star-wattage of his achievements, in person the tall, slim Cerny is soft-spoken, unassuming and friendly. During an interview last Friday, he told me that among his favorite early experiences were his onstage appearances with the Boys' Chorus for both the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Symphony. He also enjoyed stints conducting the Berkeley Youth Orchestra and the San Francisco-based Prometheus Symphony.\n\n It was even via music that he even met his future wife, Jennifer: he was conducting productions of two little-known Puccini operas, *Edgar*, and *La Villi*, in Marin County, while she was singing in the chorus.\n\n With a hint of pride in his voice, he related that he and his wife are parents of four sons, ages 8, 9, 11, and 16, all of whom are accomplished on stringed instruments. \"Both Jennifer and I practice music with our boys.\"\n\n When asked about his goals for his new Company, he voiced a formidable list of goals, foremost of which is to increase the company's endowment to $100 million and, like recent efforts by San Francisco Opera's General Director David Gockley, Cerny hopes to extend opera into the community-at-large.\n\n So, thanks to our own Bay Area, \"The stars at night/Are big and bright/Deep in the heart of Texas!\"\n\n![](/images/cerny-dallas.jpg)\n\nKeith Cerny at the Dallas Opera\n\nPhoto Credit: Karen Almond, Dallas Opera",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Jeremy Cohen**\n\n*Classical Music Column for ANG Newspapers, January 11, 2002*\n\nOn October 5, 1957, a lot of people on the planet were mesmerized by Russia's succesful launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to be set into orbit around the earth. But for Mr. and Mrs. Cohen of Oakland, an earthbound event on the next day, October 6, eclipsed even Sputnik. That was the day their third son, Jeremy, was born. Now, 44 years later, it has become a day that aficionados of jazz violin and country fiddling have come to appreciate.\n\nCohen, the youngest of the musical Cohens' three very musical sons (his brother Joel is a cellist with the Boston Symphony, while brother Joshua plays both double bass and violin with various chamber ensembles in the Bay Area), has become the heir of such jazz violin legends as Joe Venuti, Eddie South, and the great Stephane Grappelli. Yet, listed among his favorite teachers is none other than the great classical violinist Itzhak Perlman. Not exclusive in his musical tastes, when Cohen is not playing jazz or country music, he might be performing as the concertmaster in touring musicals such as the recent San Francisco performances of *Fiddler on the Roof*, *The Phantom of the Opera*; or *Forever Tango*. Or, he might be sighted playing Mahler among the strings of the San Francisco Symphony where he is an occasional substitute, or simply jamming it up with a few colleagues gathered in someone's living room playing Messiaen's *Quartet for the End of Time.*\n\nCohen's next public performance will be as guest soloist with the Peninsula Symphony, under the baton of Mitchell Sardou Klein, in concerts scheduled for 8 p.m. tonight at the Performing Arts Center, 600 N. Delaware Ave., in San Mateo and again at 8 p.m. Saturday at Flint Center on the DeAnza College campus, Highway 85 at Stevens Creek Blvd., in Cupertino.\n\nThe concert is entitled \"Jazz and Richard Rodgers,\" since 2002 is the 100th anniversary of the late Rodgers' birth. As a fitting tribute to the American master, Cohen was commissioned to write a special new work for violin and orchestra, \"Rodgers without Hammerstein,\" which will receive its world premiere during the upcoming concerts. Other works on the program will be orchestral renditions of the Overture to Rodgers and Hammerstein's *South Pacific*; *Carousel Waltz*; and *Slaughter on 10th Avenue*.\n\n*\n\nFollowing the intermission, Cohen and his Trio, consisting of Don Turney, piano; Dix Bruce, guitar; and Jim Kerwin, bass, will combine to perform Black Gypsy*; an Ellington Medley; *Wild Dog*; *Sweet Georgia Brown*, and the wildly successful *Jeremy's Hot Fiddle Soup.* (Cohen loves to cook, as well as to ski, snorkle, and more, in his spare time).\n\nDuring a recent telephone chat, the multifaceted Cohen explained that the \"Rodgers without Hammerstein\" piece is actually his own arrangement of Rodgers' *Blue Moon* and *My Funny Valentine*.\" He noted that many of Rodgers' best melodies were not particularly \"jazzy,\" but rather, sweet, simple, and gentle and that they resonated with the needs of the troubled, insecure mid-20th century.\n\nThe other Cohen piece, *Jeremy's Hot Fiddle Soup*, is another matter altogether. Jazzy, fast-paced, and hot, it was a featured work when he and some colleagues were invited to participate in the \"Django Reinhardt Festival at the Hot Club in Paris, France last year. A follow-up performance happened last October when Cohen and the combo called the Hot Club of San Francisco, were invited to play in a jazz festival in New Caledonia.\n\n\"It was one of the best three weeks of my life,\" Cohen said. \"In addition to the great musical experiences, there were beautiful landscapes, and time for snorkling in coral reefs.\"\n\nHe also found time during his busy 2001 to participate with the San Francisco Symphony as a country fiddler, clad in a cowboy costume, for the Symphony's special concert honoring retiring board president Nancy Bechtle. According to Cohen, the Symphony's conductor, Michael Tilson-Thomas, asked his string players during a rehearsal if any of them could do genuine country fiddling. Jeremy Constant, who had been Cohen's college roommate, volunteered his friend's services. So, to honor the country music-loving Bechtle, MTT wrote a special fiddling tune which Cohen, a percussionist, a bass player, and MTT at the piano, performed for the celebratory event.\n\nIn addition to his multiple Bay area musical activities, Cohen has spent a year and a half playing viola and violin with the famed Turtle Island Quartet, performing in a number of movie soundtracks and recordings at the Skywalker Studios, making three CDs of his own, doing more and more orchestrations and arrangements; and working as the co-chair of the string department of the Henry Mancini Institute, which is housed on the UCLA campus in Los Angeles. He is also a devoted father to two sons, an 18-year-old who is aiming for a football scholarship, and a 6 foot 2 inch 14-year-old.\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### James Conlon Interview\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - June 2, 2006*,\nunder\nheadline,**\"Conductor trying to preserve musical legacy\"**\n\nClassical music might be very different today, had World War II never happened.\nThat's a contention made by maestro James Conlon, the thoughtful conductor heading up the San Francisco Symphony's 2006 June Festival, beginning Wednesday and continuing until June 25 at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.\n\nAccording to Conlon, \"Those who performed, wrote or taught classical music after 1945 did so with enormous omissions. The Third Reich had, with its racist ideology and the systematic suppression of Jewish musicians, artists and writers, silenced two generations of composers and, with them, an entire musical landscape.\"\n\n*\n\nDuring a fascinating telephone interview last week, Conlon elaborated on just how different this \"musical landscape\" might have been if the late-Romantic period music of Alexander von Zemlinsky, Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas, Karl-Amadeus Hartmann, Franz Schreker, Erwin Schulhoff and colleagues had been allowed to naturally cross-fertilize with the more austere, acerbic modernists like Stravinsky, Varese, Stockhausen, Boulez and the like.\n\nSince the circumstances of the war aborted this natural selection and evolution, so to speak, music history was thereby unnaturally altered.\n\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"that this entire 'lost generation' embodies a spirit that needs to be heard.\"\n\nBy reviving this music, Conlon is trying to correct the unfortunate void.\n\n\"I intend, in coming years,\" he wrote in a 2003 essay, \"Recovering a Musical Heritage: The Music Suppressed by the Third Reich,\" \"to perform this music regularly, with the hope that it will find its place in the standard repertoire.\"\n\nHe is convinced that listeners will find much of this music far more tonal than other music we normally associate with this period of time. For instance, Zemlinsky and his colleagues more or less rejected the rigid serialism and atonality espoused by the \"moderns\" such as Berg and Webern.\n\n\"Of course, the music of this forgotten generation can be bracing and dissonant, but it usually has tonal resolutions. It is music with tremendous energy ' it has teeth,\" he stressed.\n\n\"I sometimes call these composers the 'children' of Mahler.\"\n\nWe in the Bay Area will be able to reap the benefits of Conlon's provocative resolve during the upcoming festival, duly dubbed Romantic Visions from Paradise to the Abyss.*\n\nA special symposium titled \"Out of the Depths to the Light\" will open the festival at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Davies. Conlon will introduce the audience to the times and cultural climate that gave rise to the music of this period.\n\nConlon hopes this programming will help audiences discover \"how the arts can nurture each other, and how that cross-pollination expands music's power to enliven and enrich our lives.\"\n\nAided by selected San Francisco Symphony musicians playing musical examples, Conlon will focus on the writers and artists, including Oscar Wilde, Dante, and Manzoni, who so powerfully had an impact on this period.\n\nThe second program, scheduled for 8 p.m. June 9 and 10, will open with Three Dances, arranged by Conlon, taken from Schreker's *The Birthday of the Infanta*, Zemlinsky's *The Dwarf* and the \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" from R. Strauss's *Salome*. All of these selections were based on works by Oscar Wilde.\n\nThe main event of the program will be a concert performance of Zemlinsky's *A\nFlorentine Tragedy*, also inspired by Wilde, featuring soprano Carol Vaness (Note: Kate Aldrich substituted in the performances for the indisposed Ms. Vaness), tenor Kim Begley and bass-baritone James Johnson.\n\nOne of the world's greatest descriptive, dramatic blockbusters, Giuseppi Verdi's *Requiem*, will be conducted by Conlon at 8 p.m. June 15, 16, 17, 21 and 24, and at 5 p.m. June 25 at Davies. Conlon has assembled some superstar soloists ' soprano Christine Brewer, mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, tenor Frank Lopardo and bass Vitalij Kowaljow ' to join the Emmy award-winning San Francisco Symphony Chorus in singing this vivid depiction of infernal terrors and luminous vistas of paradise.\n\nThe Pacific Boychoir, Ragazzi Boys Chorus and the San Francisco Boys Chorus will join Maestro Conlon and the symphony to perform Tchaikovsky's *Francesca da Rimini* and Liszt's *Dante Symphony* at 8 p.m. June 22.\n\nA special slide presentation of the paintings that inspired the Liszt work has been created to accompany the *Dante* performance.\n\nThe entire *Dante* Symphony, complete with the slide presentation and Conlon's related commentary and instrumental examples, will take up the whole period during the Friday 6.5 Series performance beginning at 6:30 p.m. June 23.\n\nAll the other festival performances will feature Conlon's special talks, geared to be both enlightening and entertaining, one hour prior to each of the concerts. These will be available to all ticket-holders.\n\nIn spite of his vast international fame and acclaim, Conlon himself is American to the core. Born in Manhattan in 1950 and raised in Queens, he was one of five children in a household led by an Irish father and a German-Italian mother. He graduated from the High School of Music and Art and proceeded to study conducting at the Juilliard School.\n\nHe made his professional operatic debut in 1971 and his conducting debut with the New York Philharmonic (at the invitation of Pierre Boulez) in 1974. Since then he has conducted major orchestras and opera companies throughout the world, as well as starring in PBS music presentations and documentaries.\n\nIn 1999, he received the Zemlinsky Prize, awarded only once before, and in 1996, was named an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government.\n\nIn 2002, he received France's highest distinction, the Legion d'Honneur, from President Jacques Chirac. He will also assume the conductorship of the Los Angeles Opera from Kent Nagano this coming 2006-07 season.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Composer David Conte**\n\n*Material from the Classical Music Column for October 1, 2010 in Bay Area News Group newspapers*\n\n Where in the world do you find classical music composers capable of rivaling the greats of yesteryear?\n\n Many serious music aficionados would suggest that the San Francisco Bay Area is an especially felicitous place to start the search. Our beautiful Bay and its environs are akin to a 21st century Mother Lode of musical gold. Veins of artistic creativity run through our hills and vales like earthquake faults. Just consider the bounty of musical riches offered up by within our boundaries by Jake Heggie, Nate Stooky, Nolan Gasser, Kirke Mecham , Frank LaRocca, Kurt Rohde, Marty Rokeach and more within the past decade.\n\n Lately, the music of David Conte has flashed from our local shores - reaching the Capitol in Washington, D.C. and from there to televisions screens all over the world. His thrilling work, *An Exhortation*, was chosen to be premiered by the San Francisco Boys and Girls Choirs for the President's Jan. 20, 2009 Inauguration.\n\n His music can be expected to dazzle audiences in faraway Berlin this coming December when his opera, *The Gift of the Magi*, will be given seven performances by the Berlin International Opera.\n\n Local folks can hear a sample of Conte's music at 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 9 in the excellent Concert Hall of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (SFCM), 50 Oak St., in San Francisco.\n\n The concert, called *Riding the Elevator into the Sky*, is part of the SFCM's *BluePrint/New Music Project.* The program's artistic director, the dynamic Nicole Paiement, will conduct the New Music Ensemble -- Keisuke Nakagoshi, piano; Wei He, violin; and the highly acclaimed soprano, Marnie Breckenridge.\n\n His songs, says Conte, are based on poetry by the late Anne Sexton and \"are composed in a style that evokes aspects of jazz and cabaret, and mixes sustained aria-type music with recitative passages.\"\n\n Conte, 55, a handsome, soft-spoken, gentlemanly sort, is a professor of composition at San Francisco Conservatory of Music and director of its excellent chorus. He is armed for the job with a doctorate from Cornell University, a Fulbright Scholarship that sent him to study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, a Ralph Vaughan Williams Fellowship as well as an Aspen Music Festival Conducting Fellowship. He has composed four operas, scores for films and television presentations, received commissions from a number of famous singers, including baritone Thomas Hampson and soprano Barbara Bonney, as well as from Chanticleer, the Dayton Philharmonic, the Oakland-East Bay Symphony, and more.\n\n*****\n\nMore information on [David Conte](http://www.davidconte.net/) and his compositions can be found at his website.

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Mark Delavan**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column for June 13, 2003*\n\nHad composer Richard Wagner been clairvoyant, he might well have hand-picked bass-baritone Mark Delavan to sing the title role in his powerful opera, *The Flying Dutchman*.\n\nDuring a conversation with Delavan in his Davies Hall dressing room last Monday afternoon, I was struck by how well-suited the affable singer was to play the role of the star-crossed ghost-seaman of Wagner's darkly romantic 1842 opera. With his six feet three inches of towering height and his Dallas Cowboys fullback build, Delavan looks the part. But add his simmering brown eyes with their unyieldingly direct gaze; his shock of barely behaving dark hair, his booming voice, and irreverent wit - and by golly - you've got the larger-than-life Dutchman looming right in front of you. I wish Wagner himself had been there with me!\n\nBy the time this column is published, Delavan will already have sung the San Francisco Symphony's Wednesday evening performance of the cleverly staged *The Flying Dutchman* at Davies Symphony Hall. But despair not, tickets might still be available for one of the four remaining performances.\n\nJoining Delavan in the stellar cast assembled by SFS management are Jane Eaglen, the world's reigning Wagnerian soprano, as Senta, the one woman whose love is capable of freeing the Dutchman him from his damnation; Stephen Milling as Daland, Senta's sea captain father; Mark Baker as Erik; Eric Cutler as the Steersman; the San Francisco Symphony Chorus under the leadership of Vance George; and Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the San Francisco Symphony.\n\nDelavan brings the experience of 26 previous performances as the Dutchman to San Francisco. With his large frame sprawled comfortably in an easy chair, he reminisced about some of his earlier stints as the tormented seaman.\n\n\"During one production my face was made up like a skull, with dark circles around my eyes and hair standing out so that I looked like one of the singers in the rock group, *Kiss*. In another, the director had me doing all sorts of wrenching physical exertions so that I was exhausted after every performance. Ah - and then, there was that INFERNAL coat I had to wear in another Dutchman,\" he boomed out, arms gesturing dramatically. \"It must have weighed at least 40 pounds and I looked like I was wearing a big black bear. It was awful. I suffered. I'll never wear a fur coat again!\"\n\nSo what about the San Francisco Symphony's \"Dutchman?\"\n\n\"I intend to bring a dark, smoldering rage to the role,\" he said. \"After 700 years of failure at finding the one woman whose love would be constant, the guy's just got to be skeptical and angry. So, I play him with a kind of wildness.\"\n\n*\n\nDuring his youth, Delavan actually did want to go into professional football. \"My parents were both singers, choral directors, and teachers,\" he explained. \"I saw the ground floor in opera and thought that if this is what it's like, I want NO part of it at all.\"\n\nEventually he realized that he wasn't committed all that much to football, so he started college with a triple major: business, art, and music.\n\n\"But, I hated the business classes so much, that I told my Dad, if I didn't get out of them I would end up hurting somebody. I got my first Bachelors Degree in art, with a music minor thrown in for insurance.\"\n\nIn fact, when Delavan first greeted me in his dressing room, he was holding a finely carved, polished piece of wood that looked as though it was destined to become the handle of a dagger or a cane. \"I carved it,\" he said. \"After a while interrogating the universe (praying), I came up with the idea of working with wood, polishing and carving it, while on tour. I love art in general - painting, sculpting, and working with ceramics. Helps me keep my sanity.\"\n\n\"But my Dad eventually took me aside and told me, that in all his experience teaching music, he had had only two students with what he called 'It.' By this he meant the spark and the quality needed to make it as a professional opera singer. I was one of them.\"\n\nEven though the younger Delavan was a bit resistant at first, the seeds were planted and, he says, \"they spread through my psyche like a virulent bacterial infection. I became thoroughly hooked on opera and singing and spent hours studying recordings of Sherrill Milnes, George London, Cesari Siepi, Leonard Warren and more. Jerome Hines became one of my mentors.\"\n\nHe eventually got a second Bachelor's degree in music and was chosen to participate in San Francisco Opera's Merola Program and then became an Adler Fellow in the graduating classs that included Dolora Zajick, Deborah Voigt, Tracy Dahl, Susan Patterson, Phil Skinner, Tom Potter, and Jacob Will, among others.\n\nHe has recently sung lead baritone roles in Othello*; *Traviata*; *Rigoletto*; *Falstaff*; *Aida*; *Carmen*; *Tosca*; *La Boheme*; and more with opera companies throughout the country and regularly sings leading roles with the Metropolitan and City Operas in New York City and is looking forward his first *Simon Boccanegra* with the Santa Fe Opera in 2004.\n\nHe enjoys a congenial relationship with his Dutchman co-star, Jane Eaglen and chuckled that the two of them have great fun communicating in various dialects when they work together. \"Janie has the greatest sense of humor. She can mimic the dialects of just about any area of the British Isles, from Sussex to Manchester, to London,\" he said while speaking in the most convincing possible Scottish brogue himself. In fact, throughout our interview, he responded to my appreciative laughter by lapsing into any number of accents, including a chillingly precise German one.\n\nHe flashes his broadest, warmest smiles, however, when he talks about his family. He and Karen, his pianist wife, have given recitals together and she and two of their sons, the 3 year old and 11 month-old, travel with him wherever he goes. An older son, 13 years old, is in school in New Jersey.\n\n\"It's a challenge, taking them - and all their gear - with us on airplanes,\" he says. \"But we've both got well-developed biceps!\"\n\nDelavan can be seen in what are bound to be indelible performances of *The Flying Dutchman* at 7 p.m. tonight, Sunday and on June 21; and at 8 p.m. Thursday at Davies Symphony Hall.\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Joyce DiDonato Prior to Her Recital at the Herbst Theater, November 16, 2009**\n\nMaterial from the Classical Music Column for the November 13, 2009 Preview Section and Inside Bay Area website, Bay Area News Group, under the headline, \"DiDonato dips into Latin repertoire to keep dazzle going.\"\n\nBy Cheryl North\n\nRemember Dorothy's exclamation to her little dog Toto in the classic movie *The Wizard of Oz*? \"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore,\" she said as the two emerged from the tornado-transported farmhouse into the magical Technicolor of Oz.\n\nSimilarly, Kansas-born mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato must be having like thoughts each time she steps forth onto one famed international stage after another and into the glittering, also magical, world of grand opera.\n\nShe has ascended to superstardom with her thrilling trills, turns, and roulades in the coloratura roles of Rossini's operas. She earns equal praises for her transcendently sublime sallies through stately Handel operas.\n\nHer only peer in such dauntingly difficult roles seems to be the Marilyn Horne of a couple of decades past. Both DiDonato and the legendary 75-year-old Horne are pleased with the comparison.\n\nLocal audiences will have a rare opportunity to experience the magnetic DiDonato's solo recital skills in a San Francisco Performances-sponsored concert Monday in San Francisco's Herbst Theatre. Accompanying her at the piano will be John Churchwell.\n\nHer program will consist of a single selection each from a variety of Southern European composers, along with song sets by the Italian-Tunisian Francesco Santoliquido, the Spanish-Catalonian Fernando Obradors; Spanish composer Enrique Granados and a set of her favorite songs by Cuban Xavier Monsalvatge, a composer whose music she describes as \"in the style of early 20th-century Italians like Puccini.\"\n\nSo, why is an Irish-American girl singing a uniquely Latin program?\n\n\"I feel a strain of Latin in my blood,\" the affably unaffected diva explained during a recent telephone interview. \"I identify with the heat, rhythm, and passion of such music.\"\n\nDiDonato, 40, is the sixth of seven children born into the Flaherty family of Prairie Village, Kansas. Her father was the local church choir director — and not unexpectedly, all seven children turned out to be musical.\n\n\"I grew up singing,\" she said. \"One of my favorite things to do as a toddler was to sit off to the side during choir rehearsals and watch my father conduct. I joined his choir myself when I was in the sixth grade.\"\n\nBut rather surprisingly, she does not believe she has a natural singing voice.\n\n\"Starting out, my strongest quality was my stage presence \"... I've always been attracted to acting and initially intended to teach high school vocal music and musical theater. My vocal skills came later, when I really began working on my technique,\" she said.\n\nNow critics describe her glorious voice as \"having the power to draw the listener to her,\" as being \"round and plummy,\" \"lean and insinuating,\" \"bubbly and light\" and a host of other superlatives. A New York Times critic acclaimed that \"added to her lovely voice and precise coloratura were superb dramatic skills: she spoke volumes with a sly smile or an arched eyebrow.\"\n\nShe earned her first degree from Wichita State University in 1992 and went on to concentrate on vocal performance at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. In 1995, she was accepted into Santa Fe Opera's Young Artists Program — and she was named the company's \"Outstanding Apprentice Artist.\" She was snatched up by the Houston Grand Opera to participate in its young artist program in 1996 and in 1997, by San Francisco Opera's Merola Program.\n\nSince then, she has accumulated a heap of awards and critical accolades — and they just seem to keep coming. Among them are the Richard Tucker Award in 2002, the Beverly Sills Award in 2007 and most recently, one of the 2009 Opera News Awards. She has also just released an EMI/Virgin recording, \"Colbran, the Muse: Opera Arias by Rossini,\" which is already on the Billboard chart.\n\nBut perhaps her latest claim to notoriety occurred during last summer's production of *The Barber of Seville*\" at London's Covent Garden. \"Go break a leg\" is the traditional good luck admonition to give someone before he goes on stage to perform. DiDonato actually did just that — broke her leg, right in the middle of the performance. But, with the help of her gallant cast members and a cane, she carried on. For the rest of the run, she navigated about the set in a wheelchair and a stylish pink cast.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I've always been a bit of a klutz, with weak ankles and rubber bands for ligaments. But, I'm also very Midwestern. If I have a job to do, I'll do it no matter what. Even though it hurt, my adrenaline kicked in and I simply did it,\" she said.\n\nAfter Monday's San Francisco concert, she's off to Los Angeles Opera to reprise her inimitable Rosina in *The Barber of Seville*.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n![](/images/title-donose.gif)\n**\n\nDonose goes from glamour queen to boy, with motherhood in between**\n\n[The Oakland Tribune](http://www.oaklandtribune.com/stories/0,1413,82%7e1809%7e702395,00.html), Friday, June 28, 2002\n\nRuxandra Donose, the beautiful young Rumanian mezzo-soprano who set male hearts racing in her role as Poppea in Monteverdi's ``L'Incoronazione di Poppea\" during San Francisco Opera's ``Femmes Fatales Festival\" in 1998, has returned to the site of her conquest. But a lot has changed.\n\nInstead of gliding about the War Memorial Opera House stage in Poppea's sinuous silvery 1930s style gown or her flaming scarlet coronation costume, Donose's slender form is disguised with the heavy baroque-style fabrics and adornments worn by Sesto, the angry adolescent boy who seethes to avenge the murder of his father in the opera's current production of Handel's ``Giulio Cesare.\"\n\nThere are a number of other changes in Ruxandra's life as well. Four years ago her traveling companion to San Francisco was her theater-director father. Now her entourage consists of her new German-born husband, Peter Pawlik, who is built much like an American football player, their exuberant 18-month-old son Max, and his German-Rumanian-English-speaking au pair.\n\nWhen not traveling, the young family lives in Austria where they share an idyllic bit of domesticity with little Max and even indulge in some mini-gardening (herbs and flowers) on the deck of their Vienna home.\n\nBut they share even more: both are passionate about opera and theater. Peter currently heads the Stadetteater Hildesheim in Northern Germany and frequently directs productions throughout the rest of the world.\n\nThe two met when she was rehearsing the role of Olga in a Vienna State Opera production of ``Eugene Onegin.\" During a recent chat, the handsome, affable Peter recounted their meeting.\n\n``I was the assistant director for the production. She had a dance sequence to rehearse with the tenor (Neil Schicoff), but he hadn't arrived yet. So I summoned my courage and volunteered to be her dancing partner. That changed our lives,\" he said with a triumphant hand flourish and a twinkle in his eyes.\n\nThey were married in a civil ceremony in Vienna, followed by a grand Rumanian church wedding in Bucharest that, according to Ruxandra, ``lasted from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m.!\"\n\nSubsequent challenges have including singing a number of roles during her pregnancy. She battled morning sickness while singing a critically acclaimed Cherubino touring Japan with Seiji Osawa. She also sang a Grammy-nominated ``Stabat Mater\" by Dvorak, led by Giuseppe Sinopoli shortly before his death.\n\nOne of her more difficult tasks was to sing her first Melisande for the Cincinnati Opera's production of Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande\" when she was five months pregnant.\n\nRecounting the grueling tale, she said, ``After flying 16 hours from Japan back to Vienna and then another 12 from Vienna to Cincinnati, my luggage was lost. Then there were two weeks of rehearsals for what I think is one of the most difficult roles to learn in the whole opera repertoire.\"\n\n``The funny thing,\" she continued, ``is that Melisande is supposed to be pregnant in the opera. But because I didn't show enough, they had to stuff a pillow in my costume to get a more visible tummy!\"\n\nShe sang concerts until only 2 1/2 weeks before Maxi's birth in Lyon, France. Then after seven weeks of lullabies, she returned to opera to sing the role of in Sesto in Mozart's ``Clemenza di Tito\" in Strasbourg.\n\nRuxandra is unique among the half dozen or so super-star mezzos in the current opera world. Along with her versatile voice, she has the figure and face of a fashion model wedded to an unusually acute musical talent and intelligence.\n\nWere it not for a quirky turn of fate, she would have been a concert pianist instead of a singer.\n\n``I was a very serious pianist from the age of 6 until 18,\" she explained, noting that she had won many piano competitions while growing up, including an important first place in an international event in Italy during her teens during which she triumphed with a program of muscular Chopin Etudes and Prokofiev's bone-bruising Sonata No. 2.\n\nThen, at the beginning of her senior year at the music and art high school in Bucharest, something rather astonishing happened. As part of a required accompanying class, piano majors were required to do some singing. Up until this point, Ruxandra had sung very little.\n\n``We all had to sing a piece before this great, very dramatic, teacher while she played the piano,\" Ruxandra remembered. ``After I had sung only a little, she made a loud clap on the piano, stood up, and shouted quite dramatically, `My God! I'm going to make a mezzo out of you that will burn this place down!\"'\n\n``I was shocked,\" Ruxandra continued. ``But, surprisingly, after a while, I found that I was not as shy or scared when I sang as I had always been when performing on the piano. It felt so natural and easy to sing on stage and I felt that I could really express myself with my voice.\"\n\nPeter and Ruxandra look forward to working together once again in a production of Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos\" next spring in Philadelphia - she will sing the role of the composer and he will serve as stage director and perform the speaking role of the Major-domo. Meanwhile, he will stage Massenet's ``Werther in Hildesheim in the fall and ``Hansel and Gretel\" in Vienna in the winter.\n\nMeanwhile, catch Ruxandra's glorious voice while she's here singing Sesto in ``Giulio Cesare.\" Remaining performances are at 7:30 Saturday and Wednesday and at 2 p.m. July 7 at the War Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., in San Francisco. Tickets range from $23 to $165. Call (415) 864-3330.

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Paul Dresher**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column for November 12, 2004*\n\n What do you do if there's a tune roiling around in your head, but there's no existing instrument capable of reproducing it?\n\nWell, if you are long-time Berkeley resident Paul Dresher, you simply call up your friend Daniel Schmidt and the two of you put your heads and hands together and create a new instrument. You can bet that J.S. Bach would have done the same thing, had he been living and composing in Berkeley in 2004.\n\nThe \"quadrachord,\" was the result of Dresher's dilemma. A 15-foot long construction with four fourteen-foot long strings that can either be plucked like a guitar, played with a bow like a cello, or thumped to create percussive sounds, the quadrachord was built by Dresher and Schmidt back in 2002 to provide the sounds Dresher required for his composition *In the Name(less)*.\n\nSays Dresher, \"With its very low harmonic fundamentals and its great facility with the natural harmonic series, the quadrachord can do what no other existing instrument in the western musical tradition can. It all has something to do with physics.\"\n\nBay Area audiences may hear this remarkable instrument and another called the \"marimba lumina,\" along with the whole Electro Acoustic Band, during \"Out of Bounds\" performances scheduled for 8 p.m. Nov. 17 and 18 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Forum, 701 Mission St., in San Francisco.\n\nProgrammed works are Ingram Marshall's *In Deserto -- Black Rock*, commissioned by David Rumsey for the Paul Dresher Ensemble; *Plays Well With Others* by Neil B. Rolnick (described as a rather ironic, political piece); and James Mobberley's *Fusebox*, a fusion of rock, jazz, and contemporary classical idioms.\n\nThe three Dresher compositions programmed are *In the Name(less)*, featuring both quadrachord and marimba lumina; his beautifully lyric *Chorale Times Two*; and *Din of Iniquity.*\n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday morning, even though he was rushing to pack his instruments and personal belongings to catch a flight later in the day taking him to New York City for his Carnegie Hall debut (November 12), Dresher generously made time for a telephone interview.\n\n\"We were invited by composer John Adams, who happens to be the curator for New York's 'In Your Ear' Festival,\" Dresher explained.\n\nAccording to Dresher, the Paul Dresher Ensemble, founded in 1985, and the Electro Acoustic Band, founded in 1993, both have many facets and functions. The first and foremost of the organizations' purposes, he explained, is to disseminate his and his colleague's own works. But, an equally important task is to commission and perform many works from other contemporary composers.\n\nOne of the more interesting criteria for any Dresher performance is that each should utilize both traditional and \"expanded\" orchestrations by using both traditional acoustic instruments and unique electronic or newly created instruments. In his performances, Dresher also strives to merge many diverse art forms: dance, theater, and visual media.\n\nAptly, one recent critic attending a Dresher performance, described it as \"a cross-pollination of music, visual art and theater, limited only by the imagination.\"\n\nSince its creation, the Paul Dresher Ensemble and the Electro Acoustic Band have commissioned and continue to commission or premier works by John Adams, Terry Riley, Eve Beglarian, Martin Bresnick, David Lang, Koji Ueno, Rinde Eckert, Mark Applebaum, and an ever-expanding list of major contemporary composers.\n\nAlthough the Electro Acoustic Band consists of six musicians and two sound engineers, it is often joined by noted soloists, such as pianist-composer Riley, cellist Joan Jeanrenaud, violinist David Abel, pianist Lisa Moore, and others.\n\nOne of Dresher's most celebrated collaborations has been with writer/performer Rinde Eckert back in 1985 for the American Trilogy* project -- a trio of experimental operatic works that address different facets of American culture. The first of these, *Slow Fire*, was written during the period from 1985 to 1988. Amazing for any new opera, *Slow Fire* has already received more than 150 performances nationally and three European tours.\n\nThe second of the Trilogy, *Power Failure*, was completed in 1989 and *Pioneer*, the third, was finished in 1990. Both were extensively performed, thus setting themselves quite apart from other works in the contemporary music scene.\n\nDresher has also collaborated with noted choreographer Margaret Jenkins in 1994 (*The Gates*), and with the John Adams/June Jordan/Peter Sellars production, *I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky*. More recent collaborations have been with playwright Charles Mee and director Chen Shi-Zheng for the American Repertory Theatre's *Snow in June*. Other projects include a cello concerto, *Unequal Distemperament*, for former Kronos Quartet cellist, Jeanrenaud.\n\nThoroughly a man of our times, Dresher says that, he seeks to \"integrate traditional acoustic instruments and the rapidly evolving resources of contemporary music technology.\" He pointedly added however, that he does NOT explore technology just for its own sake, but rather, for more profound, musical purposes.\n\nDresher has been insightfully called by one musicologist-writer \"both a lightning rod and a seismograph for his colleagues.\" Yet, Dresher considers himself as having a number of important things in common with composers and musicians of old.\n\n\"I, like serious composers of the past (Beethoven and Schoenberg included) have serious considerations of structure in my music,\" he said. \"Like them, I seek to make my music both compelling and entertaining in the moment, but yet sophisticated enough to endure into the future. My hope is that it will still be meaningful and therefore, played, decades from now.\"\n\nThis hope might well be realized. Dresher is thoroughly trained in the classical music tradition. Born in Los Angeles in 1951, he received his undergraduate degree in music from the University of California, Berkeley and his graduate training from the University of California in San Diego under the tutelage of the important late composer, Robert Erickson.\n\nAlso noting that his coming of age happened in the mid-1960s, Dresher stressed, \"This meant that I had access to world music traditions from Africa, China, and Japan, as well as to American Rock and Roll, and Blues. And, as a guitarist, I was deeply influenced by Jimi Hendrix.\"\n\nAll that said, the genial Dresher added that beauty and esthetics play an important role in his music. He then rather proudly quoted one critic as having written that his music had a \"rhapsodic quality to it.\"\n\n*Classical Music Column in ANG Newspapers Preview Section, March 9, 2007:*\n\nBERKELEY-BASED composer Paul Dresher is about to have one of his fondest dreams realized. During a 2004 interview, he said, \"My hope is that my music will still be meaningful, and therefore played, decades from now.\"\n\n Just last week, Dresher's music reaped high praise in the New York Times' review of the Berkeley Repertory Theatre production of Virginia Woolf's play *To the Lighthouse*. Wrote critic Charles Isherwood, \"Dresher's haunting score for string quartet is the most rewarding element of the new stage adaptation of the book.\"\n\n And now, two decades after its premiere, *Slow Fire*, one of the three segments in Dresher's highly acclaimed *American Trilogy*, will be repeated Wednesday through March 18 at Project Artaud Theater in San Francisco.\n\n In 1988, immediately after its Artaud premiere, *Slow Fire* was hailed by critics and public alike. And, amazingly for any new opera-theater piece, it has since received more than 150 performances nationally and been showcased on a number of European tours.\n\n While the music for *Slow Fire*, is Dresher's creation, the libretto is by Rinde Eckert, a polymath of a fellow who lives in Mill Valley. Not only does Eckert write prodigiously, he also acts, sings and composes music. He has collaborated extensively with Dresher on theater, music and dance productions since 1980. One of his most recent honors was the 2005 Marc Blitzstein Award, which is given to a lyricist/librettist once every five years by the New York Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nEckert will act and sing in the upcoming performances of *Slow Fire*, just as he did in its initial performances 20 years ago.\n\n*\n\nDresher has long been noted for his ability to write and perform in diverse musical styles. His experimental, sometimes groundbreaking works include operas, compositions for chamber and orchestral ensembles, and scores for theater, dance and film. He has collaborated with some of the greatest names in American and international performing arts, including Margaret Jenkins, John Adams, June Jordan, Peter Sellars, playwright Charles Mee and director Chen Shi-Zheng.\n\n Even though much of his music is experimental and sometimes contains strong, rock'n' roll-style rhythms, Dresher was thoroughly trained in the classical music tradition. Born in Los Angeles in 1951, he received his undergraduate degree in music from UC Berkeley, and his graduate training from UC San Diego, under the tutelage of the important late composer, Robert Erickson.\n\n Dresher says that his \"coming of age\" happened in the mid-1960s, and resulted in the strong influences in his own music of the traditions of Africa, China and Japan, as well as of American rock'n' roll and blues.\n\n \"As a guitarist, I was also deeply influenced by Jimi Hendrix,\" he said.\n\n During a telephone chat last Sunday, Dresher reiterated that one of his primary aims is to integrate traditional acoustic instruments with the rapidly evolving resources of contemporary music technology. Slow Fire* contains some fascinating examples of this effort; he employs a live digital \"looping\" system of his own invention to create a densely layered and richly evocative score, infused with the propulsive rhythms of rock'n' roll.\n\n Playing electric guitar and synthesizers, he and percussionist Gene Reffkin perform at the sides of the spare stage on which Eckert gives his solo performance in song, spoken word and dance — in what Dresher called \"an extraordinary physical performance.\"\n\n When I asked what he meant by \"looping,\" he explained it as being a bit like an \"instant replay\" technique that can be repeated and added to right on the spot by the musicians.\n\n \"At times it sounds like five different guitar parts playing at once and a number of percussive effects as well,\" he said.\n\n The libretto itself, according to Eckert, offers a glimpse \"of a man caught between the American dream of success and consumerism and the alienating psychoses of contemporary urban living.\"\n\n He says that the story unfolds through memories and fragmented thoughts that often involve the protagonist's \"Dad\" and the \"fractured wisdom\" he attempts to impart to the son. Only at the end are the play's secrets finally revealed.\n\n Nevertheless, Dresher assured me that the work had a great deal of humor. \"In fact,\" he said, \"this time around we have some of the same 'kids' who first saw it 20 years ago returning to see it again with their own kids.\"\n\n With its comic aspects and rhythmic qualities, kids seem to love it, and much to everyone's surprise, a lot of them have actually memorized it.\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Mary Dunleavy**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for October 8, 2004*\n\nJulie Andrews or Dame Kiri te Kanawa?\n\nAs a teenager, Mary Dunleavy couldn't decide which one she wanted to be.\n\nDame Kiri and grand opera eventually won her dedication. The beautiful, vivacious Dunleavy now takes a well-earned place among the current roster of the world's fine sopranos. She can be heard at 8 p.m. tonight as the dazzling Violetta for the San Francisco Opera's final performance this season of Verdi's *La Traviata.*\"\n\nWhen I met her for an interview earlier in the week at San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, my first thoughts were how very much she looked like a perfect Violetta. Petite and shapely, her mannerisms were gracefully feminine and her big blue eyes, expressive. She has a shock of reddish brown hair and a broad, quite Irish-looking smile.\n\nAs it turns out, she is indeed about as Irish as she can be. All four of her grandparents immigrated from Ireland to New York City. Moreover, they all loved music. Full of fiddlers and good, albeit amateur, singers, nearly every gathering of the big Irish-American Dunleavy clan ended up with the whole bunch singing folk songs and Broadway tunes.\n\nAlthough Mary was born in Saybrook, Connecticut, the family soon moved to a New Jersey town that served as a suburb to New York City.\n\n\"Some of my happiest memories are of the times when my parents would pack up my two sisters and me and take us in to Manhattan to see a Broadway musical,\" she remembers. \"Now, they're flying in from the East Coast to hear me sing Violetta.\"\n\nIt was after she sang her first lead role at age 12 in a school production of \"Annie,\" that teachers and friends urged her parents to give her singing lessons. They did, and the budding diva spent some happy years in a New Jersey public high school singing the soprano leads in the school's productions of *Oklahoma,* *Carousel* and other Broadway musicals.\n\nShe found it all pretty intoxicating. \"It was pretty exciting kissing a big senior on stage when I was only 14!\" she said.\n\nWhen it was time to choose a university, she picked one that had a reputation for its theater and music departments -- Northwestern. It was there that she had her first introduction to real opera, singing in *Tartuffe*, a comic opera composed by the Bay Area's own Kirke Mechem.\n\nIt was also at Northwestern that she met her future husband, Hal Williams. \"He kept loitering outside my dorm,\" she chuckled. \"And now we've been happily married for 12 years.\"\n\nPerhaps her most famous role has been as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's *The Magic Flute,*\n a role she has sung at least 80 times. Although she swears that the role of the old queen is now \"thoroughly retired,\" it is as an interpreter of that particular role that Dunleavy has reaped much of her most extravagant critical praise.\n\nOne critic raved that she sang the major aria with \"explosive hard-heartedness, her coloratura shooting like machine-gun fire.\"\n\nAnother maintained that \"few sopranos can articulate the coloratura fireworks so precisely or with a voice of such dramatic substance,\" while a Dutch critic from the Netherlands called her \"a dream of a coloratura soprano\" after her foray as the excitable Queen of the Night in Holland. And perhaps best of all, Anthony Tommasini, the peerless New York Times music critic, opined that \"Mary Dunleavy was a terrifying Queen of the Night...when leaping about in her upper range, including those notorious high Fs, she was fearless and faultless.\"\n\n*La Traviata's* Violetta, which Dunleavy she has sung at least 20 times, is another role with which she is exceedingly familiar. She told me that she has found it especially interesting to sing Violetta under so many different directors. Each, she says, seems to have a strong concept about how the role of the beautiful, doomed courtesan should be played. One of her favorite interpretations has been the one she sang under the direction of Renata Scotto, another great Violetta, for the New York City Opera a few years back.\n\n\"I find it intriguing to bring out all the shadows, as well as the light, within each character I portray,\" she said.\n\nThe critics seem to be in unison lauding her moving musical essays as Violetta. After hearing a previous Violetta she sang in San Francisco a few years ago, a local critic wrote, \"She dispatched the coloratura of 'Sempre libera' not only precisely but with dramatic insight...'Addio del passato' was a heartbreaker, culminating in a perfectly floated high A.\"\n\nThe critic viewing her New York Violetta raved, \"Cumulatively, she gave the sense of a flame burning within, which made the protracted carrying-ons of a dying consumptive seem plausible, fueled by sheer force of will and abundance of spirit.\"\n\n*\n\nSounds like a Violetta we all can love, yes?\n\nDunleavy explained that she isn't likely to spend a great deal of time on the recital format in the near future. She prefers being able, as in opera, to totally inhabit and develop a single character, both with song and dramatic gesture, throughout a story.\n\n\"Opera is really what makes me most excited,\" she said. \"There are even exciting challenges in some Mozart arias where you have to sing the same two lines over and over again over six or more minutes of difficult music.\"\n\nIn December, she will unveil a just such a role: Giunia in Mozart's Lucio Silla*, an opera he wrote at the age of 17, at De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam.\n\n\"* Lucio Silla* happens to have some of those arias. Maybe Mozart didn't like the original soprano singing the role, because he wrote some impossibly long arias that make you wish for an oxygen tank to help you get through,\" she said.\n\nSo far, her active repertoire includes Fiordiligi in *Cosi fan tutte; Beatrice et Benedict; Carmen; Les Pecheurs de Perles; I Capuleti e I Montecchi; Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail; Mathis der Maler; Il viaggio a Reims;* and more.\n\n\"While Violetta and Lucia of *Lucia di Lammermoor* are probably my current favorite roles,\" she said, \"I would like someday to sing a convincing Massenet 'Manon.' But then, I also love doing the lighter, more playful, things like Adina and Norina from the Donizetti operas.\"\n\nBut before all of that, she will be making her San Francisco Symphony debut as a soloist, along with Susanne Mentzer and John Mark Ainsley, in the Symphony's performance of Britten's *Spring Symphony* under the direction of Robert Spano on October 13, 14, 15, and 16, 2004 at Davies Symphony Hall.\n\nFor tonight's performance of *La Traviata*, Dunleavy's co-stars will be tenor Rollando Villazon as Alfredo; Zeljko Lucic in the role of Germont; along with Catherine Cook; Katherine Rohrer; Thomas Glenn; Ricardo Herrera; Joshua Bloom; and Stephen Bryant. Robert Wood will conduct, while John Copley serves as stage director.\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\nFeature Article on Vladimir Feltsman**\n\nClassical Music Column for ANG Newspapers Preview Section*\n\nJune 14, 2002\n\nby Cheryl North\n\nA dizzying display of piano pyrotechnics will explode through Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco next Wednesday and Thursday evenings when Vladimir Feltsman attacks Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 during the third program of the San Francisco Symphony's Russian Festival. Michael Tilson Thomas will preside at the podium as the orchestra performs a program entitled *Russian Virtuosity, Russian Rarities.*\n\n\"Had any conductor other than Michael Tilson Thomas asked me to play the Prokofiev 2nd, I would have refused and suggested another piece,\" Feltsman asserted during a telephone conversation from his home in upstate New York last week.\n\n\"It is wild, haunting, and tragic - the very most difficult piano concerto in the repertoire,\" he said in his rapid-fire Russian-accented English. \"It demanding, both physiologically and psychically and it is seldom performed because it's so excruciating to play. But, Michael (Tilson Thomas) and I performed and recorded it on the Sony label with the London Symphony a few years ago. It was very successful. Besides, I like performing with Michael. He is my friend.\"\n\nFeltsman then told a fascinating story about the circumstances of the piece's dedication, which was further amplified to me by Russian scholar Harlow Robinson, Prokofiev's definitive biographer.\n\nProkofiev met Maximilan Shmitgoff in 1909 while both were at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. They became very close friends. But in April, 1913, Max shot himself. Just before doing so, he wrote Prokofiev a suicide note that begins \"Dear Seryozha, I'm writing to tell you the latest news - I have shot myself.\"\n\nProkofiev was so moved by Max's death that he dedicated the prodigious Second Piano Concerto, along with three other pieces, to his memory.\n\nFeltsman, who is recognized as one of the most imaginative and consistently interesting musicians of our time, was born in Moscow, in the former Soviet Union, in 1952. He made his concert debut with the Moscow Philharmonic at age 11, and six years later entered the Moscow Tchaikovsky State Conservatory of Music where he studied piano with Professor Jacob Flier.\n\nFlier, he explained was a student of Konstantin Igumnov, (1873-1948) who in turn, was the teacher of the legendary Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter, who is considered to have been one of the 20th century's greatest keyboard artists. Feltsman's training extended to the Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) Conservatories where he studied conducting as well as piano. By 1971, he had won the Grand Prix at the Marguerite Long International Piano Competition in Paris and, as a result, was able to visit outside the Soviet Union during concert tours through Europe and Japan.\n\nThese experiences, combined with his own longing for freedom of expression, motivated him to apply for an exit visa to leave the Soviet Union in 1979. Soviet authorities immediately banned him from performing in public.\n\nAfter eight years of virtual artistic exile within the Soviet Union, he was finally allowed to leave. He arrived in the United States in 1987 where he performed his U.S. debut at the White House. His Carnegie Hall debut followed within the same year.\n\nDescribed by one critic as having a \"moody, prickly but oddly dashing presence,\" Feltsman has since recorded an astonishing broad range of music, including much of J.S. Bach's keyboard repertoire; a number of Beethoven's major piano sonatas; the complete *Nocturnes* and *Preludes* of Chopin; Liszt's *B Minor Sonata* and other virtuosic works; Rachmaninoff's *Piano Concerto No. 3* and his *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini*; Tchaikovsky's *Piano Concertos No. 1* and *3*; Prokofiev's *Piano Concerto No. 1* as well as the bone-cracking *No. 2*; and much more. In addition, he continues to perform as a regular guest soloist with nearly every leading orchestra in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nHe also continues to champion the music of Shostakovich and is planning to participate in an unprecedented survey of contemporary Russian piano music with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York City in January, 2003.\n\nOne of his most recent thrills was a reunion with some of his very special old friends. Last October and November he joined conductor Pavel Kogan and the Moscow State Symphony during their U.S. tour. Then in December, 2001, he performed Rachmaninoff's Paganini Variations at Carnegie Hall with famed conductor Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra.\n\n\"It was wonderful,\" he said. \"These were both guys that I basically grew up with. I went to school with Pavel, the son of the great Soviet violinist, Leonid Kogan, and Valerie and I both studied conducting in Leningrad with Illya Musin. Valerie was 19 and I was 20.\"\n\nAccording to Feltsman, teaching is now an essential part of his life - and he is keenly cognizant of the value of preserving the great Russian piano tradition, with its exacting technique and what he terms its \"unmatched emotional intensity.\" Besides teaching piano at the Mannes School of Music in New York City, he now holds the Distinguished Chair of Professor of Piano at State University of New York, New Paltz. In addition, he is the founder and artistic director of the International Festival-Institute of Piano Summer at New Paltz, a month-long training program for advanced piano students that attracts the creme de la creme of musicians from throughout the world.\n\nAt the age of 50, the fit-looking Feltsman's hair and beard are steely gray and close-cropped. He now lives alone in upstate New York and has a son attending college nearby in Connecticut. And, he still moves with almost feline energy and approaches the piano with a virility and freshness that can ignite the emotions of even the most jaded listeners.\n\nWho better to stalk the Prokofiev Second with Michael Tilson Thomas?\n\n",

Michael Morgan, its conductor/music director, seems to be innately tuned in to one of the things that make the United States so great: our deeply ingrained diversity.\n\nWhile the brochure for the 2005-06 season-opening concert next week at Oakland's Paramount Theatre says \"the program has a Russian flavor,\" I would add that it actually has an essentially American cast.\n\nThe United States is, after all, a multitextured, multicolored mosaic that contains elements from all over the world.

The result is a rather grand composition.\n\nSo, the upcoming program, which includes two major Russian masterworks ' Rachmaninoff's all-embracing Symphony No. 2 and Mussorgsky's Prelude to his opera *Kovanshchina* ' will be performed along with the world premiere of new work by Mexico-born Guillermo Galindo, set to a text by poet devorah major.\n\nThe piece, commissioned as part of OEBS' Words & Music Project funded by The James Irvine Foundation, is called *Trade Routes*.\n\n American as apple pie, yes?\n\nI had an opportunity to talk to composer Galindo last week.\nAn affable, enthusiastic Oakland resident, he explained that his early education was in his native Mexico.\n\n\"I was born right inside the heart of the biggest city in the world, Mexico City,\" said the 45-year-old Galindo.\n\n*\n\nHis mother's side of the family had been involved in the musical instrument business for years, so young Galindo grew up surrounded by music and musicians. He even \"sang\" before he learned to speak. \"According to my mother,\" he explained, \"the first thing that came out of my mouth, before I even spoke, was the melody of a 1950s rock 'n' roll song.\"\nHis mother, who was his first teacher, was accomplished on piano, organ and accordion.\n\nLittle Guillermo started with the piano and then, as a teenager, moved on to guitar. Later, he studied composition at the National School of Music in Mexico City before transferring to Berklee College of Music in Boston. While there he earned a bachelor's degree in film scoring, and later, at Oakland's Mills College, was awarded a master's degree in composition.\n\nHe has lived in Oakland since 1990.\n\nWhile he liked to perform, he claims to have always been more interested in composition and enjoyed inventing, rearranging and imagining things. \"Instead of studying the piano pieces I was given by my teachers, I would make up my own arrangements of them.\"\n\nHe explained his new work, Trade Routes*, as \"a musical tour through a contemporary American city. We (Galindo and his collaborator, devorah major) knew that our subject matter would offer us an amazing palette of musical styles, sounds and social situations to work with. The journey offers a musical interpretation of city life, the rhythm of its streets, the diversity and daily dramas of its citizens.\"\n\nHe further described it as \"a musical collage representing random synchronicities and as a complex chance operation interconnecting life styles, religions, foods and spices, values and cultural traits.\"\n\nThe work's instrumentation involves full orchestra, chorus and spoken word. The Oakland Symphony Chorus, under the direction of Magen Solomon, and major as the spokeswoman, will join with the orchestra for the piece's performance.\nGallindo says that it is set in a variety of different musical styles, with interlocking poly-rhythms supporting a flow of shifting poly-modal harmonies. He claims that it includes \"informal serialism, melodic permutations, minimalism, jazz and even 16th-century harmony, along with shades of Native American music, African music, film music, rock, funk, tango, Vietnamese, Middle Eastern and Chinese music freely combined with Afro-Caribbean and Latin reggaeton, along with vestiges of his rhythmic and electronic media experimentation.\"\n\nVery American, indeed.\n\nAs if sensing any skepticism I might have, he added that he made great effort \"to be accessible without being frugal and innovative without being elitist.\"\n\n\"We want *Trade Routes* to touch the audience at a human level. We intended it to be a contemporary musical American epic that can be understood and enjoyed by everybody. We hope our audience to be able to take a tour with us,\" he said.\n\nGalindo said that he feels fortunate to be able to support himself by teaching music and sound technology at the California College of Arts and at the College of San Mateo and by working on projects ranging from orchestral writing and special commissions for installation art, performances, opera, film music and sound design.\n\n",

I want to be able to speak to them where they live!\"\n\n Wow. What would early- and mid-20th century composers like Webern, Varese and Stockhausen have said to that? Composers like Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin and their ilk would be broadly smiling at Gasser's words.\n\n Gasser is the composer responsible for *Black Suit Blues*, the main event on the Oakland East Bay Symphony's program tonight at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland.\n\n So, why does this all send shivers of delight through my psyche?\n\n Here goes:\n\n The Arts, with a capital A, have customarily been quite prophetic, or at the very least, reflective, of the times in which they are, or were, created. Germanic literature has a term for this phenomenon: \"Zeitgeist,\" which translates as \"spirit of the times.\"\n\n Besides hosting two bloody world wars and countless revolutions and atrocities, the past century reflected a Zeitgeist that spawned a fragmented, abstract painting style with few humanistic references, as well as a spate of angular, impersonal glass-and-steel \"modern\" architecture.\n\n The dominant literature of the times was similarly grounded in objective, abstract ideas, as 19th-century Romantic and humanistic narrative fell by the wayside with works such as T.S. Eliot's fragmented *Wasteland* and pieces that followed.\n\n And what became of the so-called serious, \"classical\" music?\n\n It became mathematical, fragmented and atonal — and was often more interesting on the paper score or in theory books than it was when falling on human ears. From its former happy home in the hearts of the people, so-called concert music retreated to the remote ivory towers of academia.\n\n But, according to Gasser, \"I think music should have a narrative thread in it that can take the audience from point A to point B. This 'narration' should point to and frame some outstanding, important moment in the music.\"\n\n*\n\n Gasser, who has his doctorate in medieval and Renaissance music from Stanford University, explained that Black Suit Blues* is his musical setting of a poem by Robert Trent Jones Jr. that refers to Martin Luther King's final speeches, his assassination and its immediate aftermath.\n\n \"In setting Jones' text,\" Gasser said, \"I fashioned a detailed story line that begins with a brief fanfare foreshadowing a central motive of the work, which is eventually sung by the chorus. While the piece features a baritone solo voice, it is actually the tenor saxophone that musically symbolizes the voice and spirit of Dr. King.\"\n\n The opening sax solo includes a textless setting of several passages spoken by Dr. King during his final sermon, given at the Mason Temple in Memphis, Tenn., on the eve of his assassination. The final sentence of the sax \"sermon\" musically quotes the opening line of the *Battle Hymn of the Republic.* But just before the final word, \"Lord,\" a symbolic gunshot breaks off the sax song, which, in turn, leads to an intense and dissonant passage rife with \"screams\" in the chorus and general chaos in the orchestra.\n\n The chaos subsides and the chorus segues into the text of Jones' *Black Suit Blues*, beginning with the line, \"Wanna go home and burn my black suit\" (the black suit is the mourning suit worn to funerals). The mourning needs to stop as the poet admonishes, \"Don't sink into a sea of despair/Pray with me and I'll be there/And we will overcome.\"\n\n According to Gasser, it is about this point in the work when the spirit of Dr. King, embodied in the reaffirming voice of the tenor saxophone, is revived to join in the hymn being sung by the chorus and the grief-stricken young observer, portrayed by the baritone.\n\n Gasser actually used a device, common within the Renaissance Mass cycle, utilizing the somewhat slow, fermata-held chords that customarily accompanied the affirming lines, \"Ex Maria Virgine\" and \"Jesu Christe.\"\n\n The *Black Suit Blues* piece is just one of four segments that Gasser and Jones are writing to epitomize the essential spirit of the United States.\n \"Our idea is to create a cycle for large musical forces, using four of the quintessentially \"American\" holidays as reference points: July 4, Martin Luther King Day, Memorial Day and Thanksgiving.\"\n\n The July 4 segment has already had its critically acclaimed premiere with the Charleston Symphony, featuring Sam Waterston as its narrator during the Spoleto Festival. *Black Suit Blues* was appropriately premiered by the Memphis Symphony last year. The just-completed \"Memorial Day\" segment, featuring orchestra, chorus, mezzo-soprano, violin, trumpet and bagpipes, is set to be premiered on Memorial Day weekend by the Arkansas Symphony at the Riverfest Festival, with General Wesley Clarke introducing the piece to an anticipated audience of 25,000.\n\n Gasser hopes that the completed cycle, amounting to about an hour of music, will become a chronicle of the American experience.\n\n \"But,\" he added, \"it's not just all flag-waving. It's really questioning who we are and what are our responsibilities as Americans, including, as Ben Franklin said, to question our leaders through the difficulty of wars and the difficulty of our own past with civil rights and race issues, and ending with the gratitude and brotherhood of Thanksgiving.\n\n \"Perhaps it will someday be sort of an American 'Ode to Joy.'\"\n\n Maestro Michael Morgan will conduct the OEBS and the Oakland Symphony Chorus, with Lynne Morrow as music director, in *Black Suit Blues* at 8 tonight at the Paramount Theatre, 2025 Broadway, Oakland. Soloists will be Robert Sims, baritone, and David Henderson, tenor saxophone.\n\n Other works on the program will be the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde* and Schubert's *Symphony No. 9*, \"The Great.\"\n\n*\n\nNolan Gasser at the piano with colleagues for his Christmas Carol [Christmas by the Bay](http://www.christmasbythebay.com/song/index.html)*: lyricist Clark Sterling and singer Tim Hockenberry.\n\n*\n\nLyricist Robert Trent Jones, Jr. and Nolan Gasser, in New Mexico.\n\n***\n\nFrom August 15, 2008 Column*:\n\nMUSIC'S MAN ON THE MOVE: Armed with a Ph.D. in medieval and Renaissance music from Stanford University, rising young composer Nolan Gasser** has been providing some significant thrust into the music vs. words debate lately. His NASA-commissioned *GLAST Prelude* for brass quintet accompanied the launch of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida last June 11.\n\nHowever, his latest piece, *American Festivals*, might have the potential to become our own home-grown, thoroughly colloquial ode to joy. A joint effort of Gasser and librettist-poet Robert Trent Jones Jr., the work received its rousing world premiere in July at the opening event of Napa Valley's Festival del Sole.\n\nDescribed as a symphonic oratorio, each of its four movements — \"Independence Day,\" \"Memorial Day,\" \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day\" and \"Thanksgiving\" — includes words imaginatively set for full orchestra, chorus, soloists and/or orator.\n\nHowever, according to Gasser, his intention was to go further than perfunctory flag-waving, by relating to the people and problems of our own times.\n\n\"The words,\" he says, \"explore our national identity as well as our responsibilities as Americans — including, as Ben Franklin said, questioning our leaders through the difficulty of wars and civil rights and race issues.\" The massive indoor and outdoor Festival del Sole audience reacted with exuberant cheers, whoops and lengthy applause to the piece's premiere performance. Gasser's music brilliantly related to the poetry with relevant, inventive references such as an evocation of the pealing of the Liberty Bell on its original pitch of E-flat; the use of a tenor saxophone playing a sometimes bluesy but ultimately inspiring theme to represent Martin Luther King; intricate counterpoint passages recalling early liturgical music; the use of the haunting Native American flute, mourning bagpipes, and appealing snippets of familiar tunes and hymns reminiscent of the style of Charles Ives.\n\nHis latest commission is to create a piece he's calling *Cosmic Reflections*, a major three-movement symphony for full orchestra scheduled to premiere in October 2009 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n***\n\nNolan Gasser's *GLAST Prelude* received mention in the [July 11, 2008 issue of *Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5886/183b). Further information can be found at [nolangasser.com](http://www.nolangasser.com/glastprelude.html).\n\n***\n\n*World Concerto* Premiere. From Cheryl North's Column Published January 16, 2009.\n\nThe Oakland East Bay Symphony's upcoming concert, dubbed by its organizers *A Global Celebration*, can almost serve as a metaphor for our national identity -- e pluribus unum.\n\n Scheduled for 8 p.m. Jan 23 at the Paramount Theater in Oakland, with a repeat performance at 8 p.m. Jan. 24 at the Conservatory of Music in San Francisco, the highlight of the concert will be the World Premiere of Bay Area composer Nolan Gasser's *World Concerto for Cello and Orchestra*, with Israeli-born Maya Beiser as its primary soloist.\n\n Petaluma resident Nolan Gasser, who has his doctorate in medieval and Renaissance music from Stanford University, has been providing some significant thrusts into the contemporary music world lately. His NASA-commissioned *GLAST Prelude* for Brass Quintet accompanied the launch of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida last June 11 and his *American Festivals*, composed to a poetic libretto by Robert Trent Jones Jr., received its rousing world premiere in July, 2008 as the opening event of Napa Valley's *Festival del Sole.*\n\n Gasser's musical style has strong ear appeal to modern sensibilities and the 21st century Zeitgeist. During a telephone conversation we had a few months back, he told me that he definitely strives to connect with his audience and to address things that are important to them.\n\n \"I want to be able to speak to them (his audiences) where they live!\" he stressed.\n\n In addition to his background in Medieval and Renaissance music, he is a master of jazz, pop music, music for the stage, and music written in a solidly classical style. While his *World Concerto for Cello and Orchestra* utilizes the classical three-movement symphonic concerto format, Gasser incorporates diverse elements of eastern and western music in into its structure.\n\n Another significant commission is a work Gasser is calling *Cosmic Reflections*, a three-movement symphony for full orchestra scheduled to premiere in October 2009 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n Beiser, who has been called \"a cello goddess\" by no less an erudite publication as *The New Yorker* magazine, has gained fame and acclaim for musical virtuosity as well as her daring performance style. She has commissioned new works from some of the world's leading composers, including Tan Dun, Brian Eno, Osvaldo Golijov, Philip Glass and more.\n\n In addition to Beiser, there are other glamorous and/or exotic performer-soloists whose talents will be featured in Gasser's new work. One of these is the petite but powerful Erhu virtuoso Jiebing Chen, who was born on mainland China and whose life story could provide a perfect script for a rip-roaring movie epic.\n\n Her family, headed by her history professor father, was ordered to a \"re-education camp\" during China's infamous 1966 Cultural Revolution purge of its intellectuals. While in the camp, he took the dangerous risk of continuing the music education of his five children.\n\n Tiny Jiebing was especially talented and progressed rapidly. Four years later, when recruiters for the Chinese Navy conducted auditions for the military's elite performing arts groups, little Jiebing, who at nine years of age was too young to try out, insisted upon being heard.\n\n After she had played only a few measures on her Ehu, a two-stringed violin-like instrument, the astonished officials agreed to make her a member of the military, thus changing her family's formerly grim situation. Eventually, she graduated from the Shanghai Academy of Music, became an instrumental soloist with the Shanghai Opera Company, and in 1989, won a scholarship to further study music at the State University of New York in Buffalo. After earning honors there, she moved to the Bay Area, which she now considers her \"home.\"\n\n Another of these unique world performers will be Aruna Narayan Kalle, who was born in Mumbai, India. Kalle has the distinction of not only being one of the few existing virtuosos of the dauntingly difficult Sarangi (an ancient bowed North Indian lute-like instrument), she is the only woman to do so professionally. One of the Sarangi's unusual characteristics is that it combines both melodic strings which are actually bowed, along with a set of sympathetic strings, which are not actually played, but rather vibrate in \"sympathy\" with the bowed strings.\n\n A third exotic instrument Gasser has employed in his new world work will be the Arabic Oud, a fretless 11-stringed, plucked instrument that resembles a lute. It will be played by the Lebanese-born composer, conductor, and instrumentalist Bassam Saba, one of the major figures working in classical Arabic music today, and a participant in the Silk Road Project championed by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Interview with Kiril Gerstein, in connection with his appearance with the San Francisco Symphony playing Rachmaninoff's *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini*\n\n**\n\n*Column for the Bay Area New Group website and newspapers run on October 15, 2010.*,\n\n \"Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,\" said Winston Churchill in 1939. That very same aphorism could be applied to Sergei Vasilevich Rachmaninoff, 1873-1943, one of that country's most revered sons. He was not only a composer, but one of the world's greatest pianists, as well as a magnificent conductor.\n\n As a composer, he embarked on an intensely personal, totally contrasting path from his contemporaries - Schonberg, Berg, Webern, Varese, Scriabin, Prokofiev and others who were experimenting with atonal, serial, 12-tone, aleatoric, or highly intellectualized, formulaic music. Rachmaninoff bucked the trend by writing gorgeous, achingly beautiful Romantic tonal music. Since his music was often heavy and sometimes even grim, Igor Stravinsky, his younger Russian colleague, quipped, \"Rachmaninoff (who was indeed tall and very thin) is 6 feet, 6 inches of Russian gloom.\"\n\n Rachmaninoff suffered a nervous breakdown after the premier of his *Symphony No. 1* in 1897. Even after his recovery, he continued to struggle with bouts of depression. Through it all, he succeeded in giving the world some of its most furiously passionate, powerful music as well as some of its most poignantly sweet. His melodies, several of which found their way into popular songs or film scores, rival the best of Puccini or Tchaikovsky.\n\n Fortunately for us, Russian-born pianist Kiril Gerstein, 31, is in the Bay Area performing one of the very loveliest and most exciting of Rachmaninoff's works, his *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini* with the San Francisco Symphony under the baton of guest conductor Semyon Byckhov, another Rachmaninoff authority. Other works on the program will be Ravel's *Le Tombeau de Couperin,* and William Walton's poetic *Symphony No. 1*.\n\n Young Gerstein has already garnered some of the world's grandest piano prizes, including a first place in the Arthur Rubenstein Piano Competition in Tel Aviv, and in May, 2010, the coveted Gilmore Prize of $300,000. In short, Gerstein is a stand out - even among the world's impressive current roster of star pianists. But, even though Gerstein is known as a superlative interpreter of the moody Rachmaninoff, he retains a light, fun-loving side. During a telephone interview last week, he revealed that some of his merriest moments are when he performs with the sensational 29-year-old Venezuelan conductor, Gustavo Dudamel and his Orquesta Sinfonica Simon Bolivar, especially in Latin America.\n\n \"After the concerts are over we sometimes gather with other musicians to have jam sessions playing tangos, jazz, and other Latin pieces. One time we played until 4 a.m., even though we were scheduled to perform a matinee that afternoon,\" he said with what sounded like a bit of impish glee.\n\n His father was a mathematician and his mother, a piano teacher. He recalled that his first musical experiences were in his childhood home in Voronezh, Russia, when he would crawl under the piano to listen to her when she played or taught. She started him on the piano when he was three. He not only absorbed classical music, but also jazz by listening to his parents' many jazz recordings. He was eventually sent to one of Russia's special music schools for gifted children.\n\n After moving to the United States when he was 14, he continued to study jazz piano at Berklee College in Boston and classical at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, where by age 20, he had earned both Bachelor's and Master's degrees. At age 27 he was tapped to teach at the prestigious Musikhochschule in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\n![](/images/gersteinc.jpg)\n\nKiril Gerstein and his fiancee with Cheryl North backstage at Davies Hall, after his performance with the San Francisco Symphony on October 15, 2010\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### Cheryl North Interviews\n Rodney Gilfry\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - October 14, 2005*,\n\nThere aren't many operatic baritones in the world who can give a concert one night and run a foot race the next day. But, the fit and feisty Rodney Gilfry plans to run the \"U.S. Half Marathon\" (a formidible 13.1 miles rather than the whole whopping 26.2) later this month, after giving a solo recital the night before in Santa Rosa.\n\nAnd, a few days before all that, on October 18 in San Francisco, Gilfry will join with a group of other musical luminaries to perform a Gala Concert benefiting the Camphill Communities in North America.\n\n*\n\nHost and honorary chairperson for the concert, entitled 'Celebration at the Rim,' will be mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade. Other participants will be heldentenor Thomas Moser; mezzo-soprano Elena McEntire; flutist Paula Robison; pianist Steven Bailey; guitarist Romero Lubambo; percussionist Cyro Baptista; violinist Violaine Melancon, cellist Natasha Brofsky, and pianist Seth Knopp (members of the Naumburg Award-winning Peabody Trio); and harpist Rita Costanzi.\n\nSupported by Ms. Von Stade for the past two decades, Camphill Communities is an organization, dedicated to social renewal through community-building with children, youth and adults with developmental disabilities. It was founded in 1939 in Aberdeen, Scotland and has since grown to include more than 100 Camphill communities throughout the world, thereby providing residential care, education, therapy and meaningful work for thousands.\n\nPamela Rosenberg (outgoing general director of the San Francisco Opera), Rosemary Hewlett, Martin Sheen, Roselyne Swig, Bruce Katz, Patricia Dinner, and Peter and Mimi Buckley are among the benefit's high-profile committee members.\n\nThe concert, described as a 'classical evening with a Latin beat,' will include a number of Brazilian compositions in addition to more traditional classics.\n\nThe U.S. Half Marathon, while not really designed as a charity event, is being used as such by Gilfry to raise money for Habitat for Humanity, the worldwide ecumenical Christian housing ministry that will be building homes for hurricane victims along the Gulf Coast. Check his website, [www.gilfry.com](http://www.gilfry.com), for information about how to sign up as a Gifry sponsor.'I'll either finish the race or die!' the down-home-friendly Gilfry assured me.\n\nIn response to my question about what motivates him to perform in so many charity events, he said, 'Life as an opera singer can be rather egocentric, with the world seeming to revolve around you and your voice. But, I have been so blessed and am so happy with my career and family,\nthat I really feel driven to use my talents to give something back to society. So, when Pamela (Rosenberg) first asked me to participate in the Camphill event, I, of course, said yes.'\n\nHe suggested that another reason for his Camphill interest was because his mother, who currently leads a childrens' choir, taught handicapped children in California public schools for 26 years. His father taught music and conducted the orchestra in public schools and could, according to Gilfry, 'play almost every instrument in the orchestra with a considerable proficiency.' The rest of his family also displays uncommon musical ability: his sister is a jazz singer; his brother, a trumpet player and music teacher; and his 20-year-old daughter, a vocal student at USC. His 15-year-old son is a singer-songwriter with a rock band with a couple of CDs already to its credit, and his 18 year-old-daughter, while also musical, is studying creative writing, also at USC.\n\nBorn 46 years ago in Covina, California, Gilfry said that one of his earliest musical memories was of his father 'blasting' Beethoven's 9th Symphony over the family hi-fi.\n'He would get almost giddy about the power of the music, especially the barrel-chested baritone's singing. I came out thinking that it must be pretty 'cool' to sing like that,' he said.\n\nWhen at Claremont, California High School, Gifry was on both the wrestling and cross-country teams ' and indeed, even now, at the age of 46, he has the build of a professional athlete as well as a star-power grin than can rival Julia Roberts'.\n\n In addition to his athletics, he also sang the lead in a number of the high school's musical productions. 'We did L'il Abner* in my last year,' he reminisced. 'It was then that I really felt the power and thrill that a singer can have performing for an audience.'\n\n*\n\nEvidently, he also exerted some potent power over soprano Tina, his leading lady in many of the school's musicals. When he was 21 the two married and started their family. He continued his education at California State University Fullerton, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and then at USC, where he was awarded a Master's Degree in Vocal Arts.\n\nHis virile singing and vivid stage presence burst on the international opera scene when he sang the role of Stanley Kowalski in San Francisco Opera's 1998 world premiere of Andre Previn's A Streetcar Named Desire.* He has since wowed audiences with an incredible versatility ranging from Baroque to 21st century masterpieces in such roles as Oreste in Gluck's *Iphigenie en Tauride*; Figaro in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*; the title role in Mozart's *Don Giovanni*; Papageno in *The Magic Flute*;' Count Danilo in *The Merry Widow*;' and the title roles in Monteverdi's *Il Ritorno d'Ulisse* and Tchaikovsky's *Eugene Onegin*.\n\nHe names Benjamin Britten's *Billy Budd* as his current favorite role and is preparing to sing Jack London in composer Libby Larsen and librettist Philip Littell's new opera *Every Man Jack*.\n\nIn addition to all of the above, marathon man Gilfry gives masterclasses throughout the country and continues his weekly radio broadcasts as co-host with Suzanna Guzmian for *Los Angeles Opera Notes on Air* on KMZT, 105.1 FM, Los Angeles.\n\n",

The young 37-year-old tenor is currently in the Bay Area rehearsing for his upcoming role in the first opera of the San Francisco Opera's 2000-2001 season, Verdi's 'Luisa Miller,' with Patricia Racette, Elena Zaremba, and\n\n![](/images/giordani.jpg)\n\nPaolo Gavanelli, scheduled for performances on Sept. 9, 13, 17, 19, 22, 28, and Oct. 1. Most local opera aficionados will remember him as the exceptionally fine Fernando in last season's production of Donizetti's 'La Favorite;' and previous local leads in 'La Traviata' with Carol Vaness; in 'Lucia' with Ruth Ann Swenson; and 'La Boheme' with Patricia Racette.\n\nYes, he is Italian -- Sicilian, in fact. But he's neither short, chubby, nor convinced he's God's gift to music or womankind. Rather, he's surprisingly modest and intent on improving both his voice and his art and he's been a devoted husband to the love of his life, Wilma, for the past 10 years. He's also a tireless supporter of aspiring opera talent and has recently established the Michele Guagliardo Fellowship, named to honor his late father, at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia.\n\nThe words 'tall, dark, and handsome' fit him like a glove and he has a relaxed sense of humor and doesn't seem to take himself too seriously. But, in spite of all that, he can soar up to the high C's with the precision and power of a guided missile. Moreover, he has gleaned critical praise for his 'sensitive legato' and for being 'secure of pitch, even and expressive through all registers and all dynamic levels, from a feathery pianissimo to an earth-shaking forte.'\n\nQuite a package.\n\nDuring a chat at the opera house last week, the affable tenor revealed that he'd been singing since he was a small child in the small seaside town of Augusta, near Siricusa, in Sicily. 'I would sing everywhere -- in church, in the shower, everywhere. When my singing disturbed my older brothers watching television in our small apartment, my father would always tell them to let me sing -- that it was a wonderful thing that I was singing,' he said.\n\nThe tenor also credits the elder Guagliardo (Giordani is Marcello's stage name) for his sense of values. 'He told me,' said Marcello of his father, 'that if ever I am blessed with a successful opera career, I must give something back to the profession by helping young singers. Now I have an opportunity to fulfill his wish.'\nIn reminiscing about his youth, he said, 'Although I was born with high notes and had a naturally strong voice, I knew I had to get training and to learn proper technique. When I was 17, my father and I searched for teachers. It was difficult to find one in Sicily. Finally, I found Signora Maria, a wonderful 82 year-old soprano in Catania. She adopted me like a son and made me work up to eight hours a day on singing.'\n\nHe stayed with Signora Maria for three years and then set out to get further lessons in Milano.\n\nBy the time he was 23, he made his professional debut singing the role of the Duke in Verdi's 'Rigoletto' in the Spoleto Festival. Two years later he debuted as Rudolfo in Puccini's 'La Boheme' at the great La Scala Opera in Milano.\n\nHowever, the year 1994 was a turning point for him. What he now considers to have been an inadequate technique, contributed to major problems with his voice. It was also the year that his father died. It was then that his manager suggested that he move to New York to study with a teacher well suited to his particular vocal problems.\n'This teacher was only 35 years old. I didn't trust him at first. What could one so young teach me? But his pedagogy just opened my voice. I felt like I was free,' Giordani said, punctuating his speech with a wonderful 'vocabulary' of hand and arm gestures. 'This teacher was a miracle for me. My voice has become brighter and has more even coloration throughout its range. It's even bigger.'\n\nCritics and opera administrators seem to agree. He is besieged with offers from major opera houses throughout the world to sing major roles in the Italian and French repertory. He has just finished a run of Massenet's 'Werther' with Jennifer Larmore in Vienna and excerpts from 'Tosca' with Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic before 100,000 in Tel Aviv. Besides his local appearances in 'Luisa Miller,' in the opening night gala honoring Lotfi Mansouri on Sept. 8, and 'Simon Boccanegra' in SFO's Verdi Festival next June, he is preparing for the role of Lenski in the Metropolitan Opera's upcoming 'Eugene Onegin' production. He is also generous with his talent and plans to participate in benefit concerts in Connecticut and Sicily later in the year. In addition, there are always a few recitals on the back burner, since he genuinely enjoys the intimacy recitals allow with an audience.\n\nWhen I asked him what he liked about San Francisco, he made an Italianate sweep with his right arm and said, 'Everything! I like the view. The weather. The people. The food. Everything! If I were going to live in the United States, I would choose San Francisco.'\n\nHe likes it so much, in fact, that his wife and their two sons -- Michele Francesco, age 3, and Gerard Andre, age 2 -- were due to appear within the hour at his next rehearsal, and his older brother and his family are due for a September stay.\n\n'My wife and boys travel with me wherever my singing engagements take me,' he said. 'We know we won't be able to do this as easily when they are in school, so we are enjoying travel together now.'\n\nHe also enjoys American movies and claims to have perfected his English by watching American cartoons on television (his wife, a Swiss citizen, speaks five languages).\nNoting his athletic build, I asked him if he was involved in sports or exercise.\n\nHe flexed his right arm to show me his biceps. 'See that muscle? It comes from eating spaghetti. That's the only exercise I do,' he said with a chuckle and did a little pantomime illustrating the Italian way of twisting spaghetti strands around a fork.\n\n'1999-2002 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Richard Goode**\n\n*Classical Music Column for ANG Newspapers Preview Section, March 29, 2002*\n\nGenius can pop up in unlikely places. Sometimes a rather extraordinary plant sprouts in the middle of a very ordinary flower garden -- or even amidst a field of weeds. At first it might not differ much from its neighbors. But as time passes, it begins to differentiate from the rest and metamorphoses into an unsolicited blossom of unique beauty.\n\nSo can be with genius. Sir Isaac Newton emerged onto the field of history in such fashion. So did Leonardo, Beethoven, and Edison. And so did the New York-born Richard Goode, a gentlemanly, deceptively average-looking, middle-aged pianist currently in the Bay Area with his violinist wife Marcia Weinfeld for a set of concerts and music-related events.\n\nGoode's musical activities last week included two recitals and a master-class in Berkeley. Remaining events will be an all-Bach recital with his wife (already sold-out), on Saturday at San Francisco's Palace of the Legion of Honor, and a solo recital, for which tickets are still available, at 8 p.m. Tuesday at Davies Symphony Hall, in San Francisco.\n\nDuring an interview in the lunch room of a Berkeley hotel last week, Goode talked about his inauspicious beginnings, eventual career and the role of music in life. His manner was genial and his expressive eyes were animated by wreaths of smile lines that make him look like a kindly character from a Charles Dickens novel.\n'I was in no way a child prodigy,' he said with unaffected modesty. 'My parents weren't involved in music, although my father had some musical ability. But, as a child, I heard mostly pop music.'\n\nNonetheless, he was started on piano lessons at age six. It was not until he was in his mid-teens that he played his first solo concert, which included Beethoven's *Pathetique* Sonata. Although he didn't win any flashy international piano competitions in his youth, he did play for the legendary pianist, Rudolf Serkin, after which Serkin invited him to participate in the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont for several summers. Subsequently, Goode was so enamored with music and the piano, that he continued music study at the Mannes College of Music in New York, and eventually, at Curtis Institute of Music, where once again, he came under Serkin's influence.\n'It just seemed the best thing going,' he said with diffident shrug.\n\n![](/images/richard-goode.jpg)\n\nBecause of his shyness about being in the limelight, Goode's initial concert appearances tended to be as a member of a chamber group or as an accompanist. He was 47 before he gave his first solo recital in Carnegie Hall. He made his first public excursion through the complete cycle of Beethoven piano sonatas during a series of concerts at New York City's 92nd Street Y in 1987 and 1988. In 1993, Nonesuch Records released his 10-CD Beethoven set, the first ever by an American-born pianist. He has since won a Grammy for his recording with clarinetist Richard Stoltzman and has an extensive discography that includes Bach Partitas, Chopin, a series of Mozart piano concerti, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, and smattering of moderns.\n\n 'I have a hard time with music I can't hear and construe tonally,' he said. 'I suppose it's a habit of ear.'\n\n Now at the height of his powers at age 59, Goode is known the world over as a pianist, and even further, as a MUSICIAN of rare genius. In addition to a full schedule of solo, chamber, and orchestral concerts throughout the world, he now serves with Mitsuko Uchida as co-artistic director of the Marlboro Music School and Festival. Almost everyone who hears him perform, including the pickiest of critics, comes away from his concerts not only edified, but awed.\n\n Certainly, Goode thinks of music as more than a way to earn a living or a vehicle to fame and fortune. When I asked his ideas about whether or not classical music could offer much to our modern world, he paused thoughtfully and then replied, 'Music takes all the possible feelings we have, and by somehow ordering them and making something meaningful out of them, creates a sense of harmony that maybe we can assimilate and carry away.'\n\n To a question about what it takes to become a great pianist, Goode said, 'What counts most is the pianist's listening ability. He must be able to listen deeply and inwardly INTO the music. It takes more than either great technique or musical ability to make a great musician. A great pianist/musician must be able to understand the IDEAS in the music. Then he has to be able to communicate them.'\n\n During his concerts, Goode certainly manages to communicate -- not only his own ideas, but the composers' as well. He even seems able to assume the mindset of whichever composer he happens to be playing, whether it be Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin, or Debussy. One critic even boldly asserted that one might 'swear the composer himself was at the keyboard' during a Goode concert.\n\n The majority of critics agree that Goode's Bach interpretations reflect a profound intellect that can fastidiously delineate the melodic and/or rhythmic motifs that weave through Bach's mighty constructions of line and design. In contrast, Goode's readings of Chopin pulse with barely bridled emotion and an uncannily idiomatic Polish 'Zal' (soul) as he moves from passages of gossamer delicacy to cascades of Romantic bravura.\n\n But it is his Beethoven that elicit the most extravagant reactions from critic and audience alike.\n 'Beethoven's music is immensely powerful and positive,' Goode said as he sipped a glass of ice tea. 'It is completely satisfying. Beethoven's music is like a meal made up of all the basic food groups. There is nothing left out.'\n\n Explaining further, Goode said, \"The piano was the instrument where Beethoven put his deepest musical ideas. And it was in his sonatas that he did the most musically wild and bizarre things and where he went furthest out on a limb.'\n\n While here in the Bay Area, the Goodes, both of whom admit to being 'gourmands,' plan to enjoy some of the region's noted dining and wine-ing venues along with as many book stores as their time permits. Both are enthusiastic, eclectic readers and have more than 5,000 volumes stashed in their New York City home.\n\n 'But I have to be careful about what I'm reading when I'm on a concert tour,' Goode said with a chuckle. 'What you read influences your state of mind, and hence your upcoming concert. During my last European tour I was reading Dickens' `Pickwick Papers.'\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Susan Graham**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column from February 2, 2007, under title:\n Busy Susan Graham Brings Her Talents to San Francisco*\n\nThe voice that rose above the rhythmic clickity-clack on the other end of the phone line was uncommonly focused and had a definite luminosity about it.\n\nNo surprise here ' it was world-class mezzo soprano Susan Graham responding in her gracefully confident voice to my slightly nervous \"Good morning\" at the onset of our interview last week.\n\nIt was indeed morning on my California end of the line, but for her, traveling on the train from Washington, D.C., to New York City, it was half past noon. The hard-working diva was en route to sing a recital of French art songs a couple of days later at Carnegie Hall.\n\nWhereas her accompanist for the Carnegie Hall concert was Malcolm Martineau, arguably one of the classical music world's best piano accompanists, her accompanists next week in San Francisco will be Maestro Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony, the best symphony orchestra on the West Coast.\n\nGraham is scheduled to perform Hector Berlioz's *Les Nuits d''t'* at 8 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday and at 6:30 p.m. Friday at Davies Symphony Hall, 201 Van Ness Ave., in San Francisco. Other works on the all-French program will be Berlioz's *Roman Carnival Overture*; Debussy's *Nocturnes*; and Dukas' *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*.\n\nShe has been widely acclaimed for her \"infinitely varied, perfectly focused and burnished bronze voice\" as well as for her intelligent, musical way with French art songs. And indeed, her recent Carnegie Hall concert included a pack of them: songs by Bizet, Franck, Faure, Debussy, Chausson, Duparc, Ravel, Poulenc and many more.\n\n\"French song has always appealed to me in a rather sensual way,\" she said over the steady hum of rail over track going on in the background. \"The sensitive scene painting that the French composers utilized in their songs ' the tonal colors, the imagery ' I find it all incredibly rewarding to sing.\"\n\nBerlioz's *Les Nuits d''t'*,\" which is usually translated as \"Songs of Summer Nights,\" had its origins with a set of poems titled *La comedie de la mort*, written by Berlioz's friend Theophile Gautier in 1838. In 1840-'41, Berlioz set two of the more light-hearted poems and four rather sultry ones to music, giving them his new, Shakespeare-tinged title. The ravishingly Romantic *Le Spectre de la Rose* is the best known of the set of six.\n\nThe statuesque Graham, who looks like the quintessential All-American girl with her bright eyes, stylish new hairdo, and broad smile, was born in Roswell, N.M., and raised in Midland, Texas. She is perhaps most familiar to local audiences for her riveting portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean in the world premier of Jake Heggie's opera [*Dean Man Walking*](c_articles_deadman.htm) in the fall of 2000 by the San Francisco Opera.\n\nHowever, Heggie's opera was not her first musical portrayal of a Catholic nun. It was when she played Maria during her senior year in Midland's Lee High School production of *The Sound of Music* that her resolve to be a professional singer was born.\n\nIn fact, Graham met Julie Andrews, the show's definitive Maria, backstage after a *Dead Man Walking* performance. After trading compliments, Susan took the opportunity to tell Julie that she \"was the first nun I ever played on stage.\"\n\nAccording to Graham, the women in her family ' including an older sister and her mother ' are all musical. Her mother played the piano by ear very well and her older sister was the first person to give Susan piano lessons. Her only brother is more athletic, like her late father.\n\n\"I got my musical ability from my mother and my lung power from my dad. He was a coach for a team and could holler so loud that he could be heard across a big field,\" she said.\n\nGraham has put both her musical ability and her good lungs to good use. After graduating from high school, she attended Texas Tech University to study singing. Singing classes, however, required participants to perform in the college opera productions, either as soloists or members of the chorus. After finally getting a taste of opera, she says that she \"fell in love\" with the art form.\n\nSoon after, she was snatched up into San Francisco Opera's Merola Program. Upon graduation, she launched into the mezzo-soprano roles of Cherubino in Mozart's *The Marriage of Figaro*, Octavian in Strauss' *Der Rosenkavalier*, and other trouser roles. Now, she is master of a far wider repertory and is equally at ease with French, German, Italian or American Opera. She has earned acclaim as a \"singing actress\" for or her fine-tuned performances in leading roles in the operas of Monteverdi, Gluck, Handel, Verdi, Barber, and such modern Americans as Tobias Picker and John Harbison.\n\nGraham has been honored by the French government with its highest award for performers, the Commandeur dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres; has garnered a Grammy; earned accolades for numerous recordings and song recitals; and has made appearances with most of the world's major symphony orchestras and opera companies.\n\nBut in typical all-American-girl character, she is thrilled that Midland has designated Sept. 5 as \"Susan Graham Day.\"\nGraham is also a good writer and has included some insightful and witty notes to her public that appear on her Web site, one iteration of which is the continuing \"Letters from Libby,\" her beloved 17[1/2]-year-old black poodle. Libby's latest reveals that, although she misses traveling everywhere with her \"Noisy One\" (Susan), she is enjoying her well-earned retirement with Susan's mother and stepfather in Midland.\n\nSusan, too, says she is surviving the retirement of her former canine traveling companion.\n\n\"I love animals. If I hadn't gone into singing, I would probably have enjoyed a whole career working with animals,\" she said.\n\nWhen I asked what she hoped audiences, colleagues and critics would say about her at her own retirement gala several decades from now, she mused that music's ultimate goal is to foster communication from one person to another, and that music can connect us as fellow humans and make us feel for, and with, each other.\n\n\"I guess I just want people to be able to say about me, that I sang the truth,\" she said with a fervor that caused her voice to soar well above the hum of wheels over rails.\n\n![](/images/graham-with-norths.jpg)\n\nSusan Graham with Cheryl and Warner North backstage after her concert on February 16, 2007\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",

Communication problems and hours of phone tag had stretched the time for our prospective interview from 2:30 p.m. on into the early evening.\n\nThe great singer is in town with his beautiful Italian-born wife, Florence, their 4-year-old son, Maxim, and 10-month-old daughter, Nina, to begin rehearsals for his starring role in San Francisco Opera's gala opening night and subsequent productions of Giuseppe Verdi's great 1857 opera, \"Simon Boccanegra.\"\n\nBaritones generally need to be at the pinnacle of their capabilities to handle Verdi roles. A good Verdi baritone requires not only a clear higher register and a lyrical quality, but considerable heft and power as well. One writer used the apt words \"dark color, bite and snarl\" to describe the required voice.\n\nHvorostovsky's near-perfect Verdi baritone had its beginnings 45 years ago in Krasnoyarsk, an industrial/scientific center in Siberia with a population of more than a million. An only child, Hvorostovsky inherited his mop of prematurely silver hair and black eyes and eyebrows from his still-youthful-looking father, who is a chemical engineer as well as an accomplished baritone himself. His mother, a slim, elegant woman with lovely expressive eyes, is a retired medical doctor.\n\nDuring a telephone interview I had with Dmitri in the budding days of his career 11 years ago, he said \"My parents both worked when I was a child, so I was raised by my grandmother, a deep and wonderful woman who spoiled and cherished me.\" He went on to say, \"I always wanted to be in music. I was bad at math, Russian and literature and I guess I was somewhat of a wild boy. I used to play soccer and liked boxing and swimming. But through it all, I loved music.\"\n\nHe attended the Krasnoyarsk High School of Arts, where he studied voice with Yekaterina Yofel and took classes in music theory, conducting and piano. Interestingly, it was his playing of a couple of Gershwin's virtuosic preludes for piano that won him his initial First Prize.\n\n\"After that, I began winning many competitions in voice — always first prizes,\" he had emphasized during that long-ago interview.\n\nSuddenly, the Zellerbach lobby silence was broken by the loud clatter of hurried footsteps dashing up the stairs from the hall's subterranean sound-proofed rehearsal studios. I looked up to see the man in the flesh, looking exceedingly fit in his body-hugging blue jeans.\n\nWith such sexy, smoldering good looks, no wonder he landed on People magazine's list of the \"World's 50 Most Beautiful People.\" I could not help but remember a Russian girl's description of him when I was in Moscow a few years back: \"He is the Russian Elvees Prezley!\"\n\nRousing from my reveries, I stammered out, \"Uh \"... I'm Cheryl. Do we \"... uh \"... have an interview?\" His face lit up into a supernova smile as he affirmed, \"Of course!\" We were soon walking together across the street to his Opera House dressing room, during which stroll, in impressive, gentlemanly fashion, he adjusted his long-limbed pace to my slower one. When we arrived, he gestured for me to take the room's single upholstered chair while he pulled up a hard-backed one for himself.\n\n\"I very much like the character of Simon Boccanegra,\" he began. \"I admire Boccanegra's innate humanity, diplomacy and peace-making character. The themes brought out in the opera are still modern and important — the idea of a united society and country, but yet dealing with the political ambitions and difficult personal egos of its characters. It is a role, like life itself, that is both complex and fulfilling.\"\n\nBecoming even more serious and intense, he expressed his feelings that it is important not to just rest on one's laurels, but to remain open to new experiences.\n\n\"Everything in my career seems to happen just at the right time,\" he said. \"A few years back, Constantine Orbelian, the conductor of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, suggested that we collaborate to perform and record some of the famous ballads popular in Russia during World War II. At first, I was not interested — but I finally consented to give it a try.\"\n\nThe results have been astonishing. \"I have to say, with full feeling, that almost every family in Russia suffered terrors, deaths and losses during WWII. After millions viewed them on television, in person, or during our tours through Russia and the West, there seemed to be a new wave of patriotism and gratitude. The music helped people remember what they and others had gone through.\"\n\nAnd, sounding more like a mature humanitarian than a matinee idol, he added, \"As long as the people have memories of the past, they will have a future.\"\n\n![](/images/hvorostovsky-sb08.jpg)\n\n2008 Poster, San Francisco Opera****\n\nVoice of the Century? **\n\n**\n\nInterview in Alameda Newspaper Group column published May, 1997\n\nThere will be an opportunity this week to welcome the San Francisco Symphony back from the successes of its recent European Tour and to check out a rumor. A number of people who have heard the young Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, have acclaimed him as having a voice that only happens about once a century.\n\nHvorostovsky will appear, along with the beautiful Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, with the Symphony, under the baton of guest conductor Mario Bernardi, in concerts at 8 p.m. May 24, 26, and 27 at Davies Symphony Hall, corner of Van Ness Avenue and Grove Street, San Francisco. The two will perform selections from Donizetti's 'La Favorita,'\n\n![](/images/hvorostovsky.jpg)\n\nRossini's 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia,' Saint-Saens' 'Samson et Delila,' Rimsky-Korsakov's 'The Tsar's Bride,' as well as various operatic solos.\n\nIt won't be the 32-year-old baritone's first trip to San Francisco, however. During a telephone interview from his New York hotel room last Monday, he explained in fluent, barely accented English. 'I came to San Francisco about six years ago to sing with a group called 'Beyond War.' It's one of my favorite cities - and as many Russians, I'm very nostalgic and want to return. It was my first United States City.'\n\nHe also explained his English proficiency. 'During my trips to the United States, I usually stayed with Americans who did not speak Russian. I had to chat with them every night after my concerts.' 'And then, of course,' he continued, 'I bought a house in London where my wife Svetlana (a ballerina) and I have been living for the past year. This too has helped my English.'\n\nHvorostovsky was born in Krasnoyarsk, an industrial/scientific center in Siberia with a population of over a million. An only child, his father is a chemical engineer and his mother, a doctor. 'I'm a little bit spoiled,' he said. 'My parents both worked, so I was raised by my grandmother, who spoiled and cherished me. I miss her a lot, but Thank God, she is still living.'\nAlthough his father has not officially retired, he, like many of his scientist/engineer colleagues in the new Russia Federation, is presently unemployed. 'My father hasn't received a pay (check) for about a half year. He hasn't got money, but Thank God, he's got me,' said Dmitri. 'I can\nsend him and my family money from my concerts.'\n\nSince the elder Hvorostovsky hasn't been working as an engineer lately, he has resumed his singing career. Also a baritone, he performed a recital series in Italy last summer. Says Dmitri, 'My father studied music mostly by himself and he is very good. As far back as I can remember, I was always watching and listening to him doing his vocal exercises. I took every opportunity to learn from him.'\n\n'There was never any conflict about what I wanted to be when I grew up,' he continued. 'I always wanted to be in music. I was bad at math, Russian, and literature. I used to play soccer and liked boxing and swimming. I guess I was somewhat of a wild boy. But through it all, I\nloved music.'\n\nHe attended the Krasnoyarsk High School of Arts where he studied with voice with Yekaterina Yofel and took classes in music theory, conducting and piano. After seven years, his piano playing became so proficient that he won a first prize for a performance of the Gershwin Preludes. 'After that I began winning many competitions in voice ' always first prizes,' he emphasized.\n\nHvorostovsky met Borodina eight years ago when both were first prize winners in the Glinka Competition in the Soviet Union. Although they subsequently went different ways, they remained close friends and occasionally met when their touring or recording schedules overlapped. It was during a recent recording session with Philips that they hit on the\nidea of performing concerts together.\n\nHvorostovsky is not shy about his strong points, nor does he deny his vocal limitations. 'I have very good breath control,' he says. 'That is one of my major strengths and it allows me to sing pianissimo in the high register. But I'm five years away from singing Wagner's Ring. Verdi also\ncomes later.'\n\nMeanwhile, he maintains a daunting touring and recording schedule. This next year he will sing Figaro in San Francisco's production of 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia,' Valentin in Gounod's 'Faust' with the Chicago Lyric Opera, and 'Pique Dame' at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In concert he will appear with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he hopes to\ndo a Mahler song cycle, and in concerts at Carnegie Hall, Washington, D.C., Fort Worth, Oslo, London, Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Munich, Basel, Paris, Lyon and Glasgow.\n\nAmong the recordings he already has to his credit (all Philips Classics) are 'Yevgeny Onegin' with Semyon Bychov, 'La Traviata' with Kiri te Kanawa, Alredo Kraus, and Zubin Mehta, and 'Cavalleria Rusticana' with Jessye Norman, as well two albums of Romances by Russian composers, two albums of operatic arias by Russian and Italian composers, and a\nsoon-to-be-released album of bel canto arias by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. He has done a massively successful cross-over recording of Russian folk songs with folk orchestra called 'Dark Eyes' that hit the top of the charts in Europe.\n\nAnd yes' I did say he was just 32!\n\nReview of San Francisco Symphony Concert of Wednesday, April 2, 1997**\n\nby Cheryl North, published by the Alameda Newspaper Group\n\nIf great opera composers of the past could have dealt with baritones like Dmitri Hvorostovsky, they wouldn't have given all the hero roles to tenors. The splendid Russian-born and trained Hvorostovsky joined with conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony for what might become the definitive performance of Modest Mussorgsky's 'Songs and Dances of Death' Wednesday at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.\n\nThe entire program - Toru Takemitsu's ``Requiem for Strings,'' and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, ``Pathetique,'' in addition to the Mussorgsky songs - was a musical essay on life's somber closing moments. The serious, sober mood of the evening seemed appropriate, and perhaps even healing, as conductor, musicians, and public once again assemble, following the recent\nstrike, to rekindle their relationship.\n\nThe concert's most riveting moments were when Hvorostovsky was in command. Although only in his early 30s, he has the vocal equivalent of a Stradivarius in residence in his throat and barrel chest. This gives his voice a warm luminosity, which extends throughout his entire vocal\nregister. When coupled with his tremendous breath control, this golden sheen is maintained through a broad range of dynamics as well.\n\nDuring Wednesday's concert, he projected an incredibly pure, focused pianissimo, even in his highest register, as well as belting out ringing crescendos of untarnished beauty. He handled the Mussorgsky songs' low notes like a bass baritone and managed the clarity and ring of a tenor through the last song's gruelingly high tessitura.\n\nHvorostovsky's keen sense of drama and innate musicality added to the excitement produced by his voice. He sang 'Lullaby,' the first of the Mussorgsky songs, with a dynamic range akin to Schubert's 'Erlkonig.' He became three distinct personas within the poignant mini-drama ' by turns, the soberly direct narrator; the agitated, heartbroken mother; and, as Death itself, ominously 'comforting' while singing to the mother that he can ease the child's pain and silence his crying - forever. In the second song, 'Serenade,' Hvorostovsky became a deceptive, vampire-like Death as he assumed the role of a wooing knight to a young invalid woman. The Russian words, translated into English, 'But at midnight, to answer her yearning, Death sings his soft serenade' and the eventual 'Listen to the sweet nothings I murmur... Be still, you are\nmine!' could send shudders down the stiffest spine.\n\nThere was an element of cynicism in 'Trepak', the third song, as Hvorostovsky sang of Death encountering an old drunken peasant in the snowy winter woods. The cycle's most intense drama was unleashed in song 4, 'Commander-in-Chief,' when Death presides over a battle and proclaims 'I am triumphant now! Victor and vanquished alike I subdue.' Hvorostovsky's\nvoice pierced like a shining blade through the dense orchestral textures simulating a barrage of artillery.\n\nAlthough Mussorgsky completed the songs in early Summer, 1877, it was Dmitri Shostakovich who gave them their rich orchestration in 1962. The Symphony musicians played well throughout the work and outstandingly in several instances. Some of these occurred during the 'Serenade' when the tympani ticked away life's waning moments like a doomsday clock and the\noboe provided a plaintive counterpoint to Death's passion. Other instances of fine musicianship happened when a choir of brass assembled to intone chorale-like passages and when the lower strings achieved an almost uncanny resonance as they accompanied Death's approach to the battlefield in the final song.\n\nMTT's interpretation of Tchaikovsky's 'Pathetique' Symphony was tightly controlled, yet weighty. Conductor and orchestra achieved a sense of epic sweep that endured through the opening bassoon lament, the second movement's offbeat waltz, the mad march of the third, and on to the utter desolation of its closing notes. The Tchaikovsky panorama also featured a number of outstanding solos. There were fine solos from the principal cello, violin, and clarinet, and a splendid rise-and-shine exhilaration from the brass as the first movement swept to its close. The strings were brilliantly unified as they played the wonderful swooshes of ascending pitches in the last movement countering the descending line played with sepulchral sobriety by the horns. At the onset, the strings sounded a bit thin and the French horns were less than distinguished. But as the work progressed, things came together to create broad sweeping phrases that crested like waves of the sea before ebbing away into a simmering calm.\n\nThe Takemitsu Requiem made for a meaningful, beautiful beginning to the concert. The late Japanese composer's synthesis of Oriental and Occidental musical elements was very much in evidence as MTT and the orchestra achieved an almost impressionistic evanescence throughout the work's single movement. Although the Takemitsu work seemed atonal in 1957,\nin the 1990s, it rests harmoniously.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### An Interview with Czech Composer\n\n Sylvie Bodorova and a Visit to\nGustav Mahler's Birthplace**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column, December 17, 2004, under headline, \"A Moving Visit to Gustav Mahler's Czech Republic\"*\n\nThe Nativity of Jesus Christ has indeed inspired some of the world's most beautiful music. But the music of the Jewish tradition has been enriched by the triumph of faith over fear as embodied in the story of Judas Maccabaeus, which resulted in the joyful Hanukkah holidays.\n\nLike Christmas, Hanukkah inspires musical minds to new creations. One profoundly thrilling new work I heard in recent years is an oratorio entitled \"Juda Maccabeus\" composed by Sylvie Bodorova of the Czech Republic.\n\n![](/images/thm-bodorova.jpg)\n\nHer work, which combines a contemporary harmonic vocabulary with melodic and rhythmic elements of traditional Jewish music, premiered last spring in the Cathedral of St. Vitus, which sits like a jewel on the hill above Prague in the Czech Republic.\n\nI did not witness the premiere, but I have listened to its live recording, distributed on an Arco Diva CD. Unlike much contemporary music, \"Juda\" is concisely, urgently thrilling.\n\nIt summons high drama with a riveting blend of narration, traditional chant, gorgeous solo vocal and choral selections, and alternatively chilling and spiritually moving instrumental passages. The finale contains what seemed to me the most exciting \"modern\" music to emerge in the 21st century. It reminded me of music by a Czech-Jewish composer whose work spanned the turn of the 20th century: Gustav Mahler.\n\nNot unlike his ethnic fellows, Mahler once lamented, \"I am three times homeless ' as a native of Bohemia in Austria, as an Austrian among Germans, and as a Jew throughout the world.\"\n\nIf Mahler were to visit now, he would have to alter that statement to something more like, \"The world is my home. I am claimed by the Czechs, the Austrians, the Christians, the Jews, and, in fact, the whole world.\"\n\nA couple of months ago my husband and I were traveling to the south of the Czech Republic on a pilgrimage of sorts to Kaliste and Jihlava. Kaliste was the village where Mahler was born, and Jihlava where he spent his formative years.\n\nJiri Stilec ' a recording company executive, music scholar and Bodorova's husband ' was our host. He's also the person largely responsible for the Mahler restorations we were about to see.\n\nAbout an hour and a half after leaving Prague, Stilec turned off the highway onto a narrow, apple tree-lined winding road, stopping at the first building before the lane curved into Kaliste. The building looked like a 19th century inn; a bronze plaque with a relief bust of Gustav Mahler dominated its roadside wall.\n\nWe were ushered first into a restaurant/gasthaus room that had been restored to its original style and had a smallish bar that made me think of American Westerns. Back in the 1850s, Mahler's father Bernard presided at the original version of this bar and room as its innkeeper.\n\nThe next room was huge. Mahler pictures and memorabilia hung on three walls; the fourth was dominated by a stage on which stood a splendid Bechstein concert grand piano.\n\nUpstairs were student rooms with beds, modern plumbing and furniture. Several other larger rooms overlooked the beginnings of a garden and a gazebo-like stage area.\n\n\"We wanted this place to be not just a museum filled with memorabilia of times past, but a new, vital place for students and scholars to study and perform music,\" Stilec explained. \"Our restoration is planned for music festivals, concerts, study, lectures, and special events. Audiences, visitors and performers will be able to stay, work and eat here.\"\n\nThe idea for the center began in the 1990s when a group raising funds for the restoration of Beethoven's Bonn, Germany, birthplace held a benefit concert in the Czech Republic. While Stilec supported the effort, he wondered why the Czechs should not be doing the same thing for Mahler, one of their own native sons.\n\nHis idea caught on. Among the donors to the Mahler project were Opel, the Gilbert Kaplan Foundation, the Britten (Benjamin) Estate Limited, Panasonic/Technics, Thomas Hampson, Stan Ruttenberg, Luciano Berio, Zubin Mehta, Henry-Louis de La Grange, Donald Mitchell, Maxim Shostakovich, Marina Mahler (Mahler's granddaughter), Jiri Belohlavek (conductor of the Czech Philharmonic) and Valclav Havel, former president of the Czech Republic.\n\nStilec also is involved in the restoration of the Gustav Mahler Hotel and Restaurant in Jihlava, where Mahler's father moved the family after Gustav's birth.\n\nBuilt in medieval times, the building more recently has served as an army barracks. Today its restored chapel and three large rooms provide performance venues and exhibition space for Jihlava's annual Fall Music Festival.\n\nMonsieur La Grange, Mahler's definitive biographer, wrote, \"When Mahler was born in Kaliste ... no one could have predicted that he would one day become one of the most famous composers on our planet ... Although Mahler's works are widely considered as belonging to the German tradition, they owe much to the inexhaustible wealth of music of various origins that he heard in his youth in Jihlava (and Kaliste). As an artist and composer, he became a citizen of the world, yet he never forgot the land of his birth to whose music he was deeply devoted.\"\n\nAnd, after my recent visit to Kaliste and Jihlava, nor shall I.\n\nWebsite for Sylvie Bodorova: [http://bodorova.cz/en/index.php](http://bodorova.cz/en/index.php).\n\n\nhref=\"http://www.bodorova.cz/en/index.php\">.\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Alexandros Kapelis**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column from March 16, 2007, under title: Greek Pianist Builds Career of Mythic Proportions*\n\nAlexandros Kapelis' life sounds about as close to an ancient Greek myth as one can get in the 21st century. At age 30, the dark-eyed, smolderingly handsome pianist, who looks a bit like a young Al Pacino in the first of the *Godfather* movies, will make his Bay Area recital debut at 8 p.m. Tuesday at Herbst Theatre in San Francisco.\n\n His recital, billed as \"The Greek Myth and the Piano,\" is one of several special events for Greek National Day, sponsored by the Greek Consulate General with support from the Department of Culture of the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Gina Bachauer Memorial Foundation of Greece.\n\n*\n\nAlexandros Kapelis with Mrs. Xenia Stephanidou, the Honorable\nConsul General of Greece in San Francisco, March 20, 2007\n\n \"I did not choose to be a musician,\" the congenial Kapelis said during a telephone interview last week. \"Music chose me. The awe I've always felt when I hear music — the monumentality of music; it was as though the choice was made for me.\"\n\n Such words sounded to me very much like they came straight from the tales of the ancient Greek Fates, or Moirae, who were described in Greek poetry, myth and drama as the goddesses who controlled the destiny of everyone from birth to death. All living things, even the gods themselves, were thought to be subject to the decrees of the Fates.\n\n \"We had an old upright piano at home,\" Kapelis said. \"When I was about 4, I remember listening to a soundtrack from a television show. It was in E-flat minor. I rushed to the piano and began to play along with it. The other people in the room thought it was 'cute' and urged my mother to give me piano lessons. It turned out that I had perfect pitch, which is very rare, and was quite unexpected, since no one else in my family was particularly musical.\"\n\n He took to his early piano lessons like a seaworthy ship takes to water. By the time he was in his teens, he had his first serious love affair: The object of his absorbing affection was none other than the great 18th-century German composer, Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n \"I remember that, while we were living in Lima (Peru), our classical radio station broadcast two hours of the music of J.S. Bach every Saturday night. I listened faithfully to every broadcast for three years, until I had heard every recorded work written by Bach. By that time I had transcribed and could play the Bach Orchestral Suites by ear on the piano.\n\n \"I really had NO choice, but to go into music,\" he said. \"It's absolutely not an ego thing. When you perform, you must lose yourself — your ego — in the music. You must become an instrument to bring a communion of truth from the composer to the audience. I as a person, become absolutely irrelevant in the equation.\"\n\n Tracing his background, he explained that his father was Greek and his mother Peruvian. His father, as a young man in Greece, developed a yen for travel and set off to see South America. While in Peru, he met and married Alexandros' mother, and the two had three children. Alexandros is the youngest. His older sister is fluent in four languages and works as a translator for the French ambassador in Peru. His older brother is head of Nike in South America.\n\n The young family was subject to the father's wanderlust, and when the elder Kapelis' homesickness for Greece became unbearable, they all picked up and headed to Papa's homeland. This meant that the children had the advantage of growing up in two cultures. They formed new friends and Alexandros continued his piano study.\n\n Besides intense study in Greece, he continued his studies in London and, eventually, at New York's Mannes College of Music, where he was tutored by Diane Walsh and Julius Levine. He also has studied conducting with Bruno Aprea at the Accademia Internazionale delle Arti in Rome and Gianluigi Gelmetti at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena.\n\n During the last few years, he has performed as soloist with the Prague Symphony Orchestra and Mexico's Monterrey Symphony, and he recently made his debut with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. He also has debuted at Lincoln Center, the United Nations, London's Cadogan Hall, the Salle Cortot in Paris, the Chicago Institute, the Musei Capitolini in Rome, the Athens Megaron and many other choice venues.\n\n His main home is now New York City, where he enjoys yoga, bicycling (\"all over NYC,\" he says), horseback-riding, traveling and reading. In fact, he is a voracious reader.\n\n He said that the genesis of his Greek myth-themed recital was a New York City exhibition of 86 paintings based on Homeric legends and Greek myths. He was asked to put together and perform a recital of piano works inspired by various Greek myths.\n\n In the recital's program notes, he writes, \"Greek myth, with its superb philosophical explorations, has exercised an inescapable force on the creative minds in all eras. The visual arts and literature have been the most vulnerable to their universal appeal and transcendence, while opera, since its inception, has been dominated by the power of its heroic and tragic figures.\"\n\n He writes well, too.\n\n His local debut program will begin with Muzio Clementi's Op. 50 Sonata No. 3 in G minor*, which was inspired by the ill-fated affair of the Trojan Prince Aeneas with Queen Dido of Crete. Clementi's subtitle for the Sonata is \"Dido Abandoned: Tragic Scene.\"\n\n Other programmed works will be Kalomiris' *Sia ta Ellinopoula*; Debussy's *Danseuses de Delphes* and *L'Isle Joyeuse* from his *Preludes*, Book I; Rameau's *L'Entretien des Muses*; *Les Tourbillons*; and *Les Cyclopes*; Constantinidis' *Eight Dances from the Greek Isles*; and a special bonus — Rachmaninoff's glorious Op. 33 *Etudes-Tableaux*.\n\n While I'm not sure about the Greek connection of Rachmaninoff's *Etudes*, I can certainly testify to their seductively mesmerizing powers.\n\n![](/images/kapelis-norths.jpg)\n\nAlexandros Kapelis with Cheryl and Warner North at a reception follwing his concert on March 20, 2007\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Victor Kissine prior to the world premiere of his composition, *Post-scriptum*, by the San Francisco Symphony on March 4, 2010.**\n\n*Material from the Classical Music Column in the Preview Section for the Bay Area News Group for publication February 26, 2010*\n\nby Cheryl North\n\nWhen American composer Charles Ives, 1874-1954, composed a piece he called *The Unanswered Question* in 1906, he couldn't have dreamed that a Russian composer born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1953, would, if not quite \"answer\" his question, at least posit a tantalizing musical meditation on it more than a century later.\n\n This new piece, called *Post-scriptum* by its composer Victor Kissine, will receive its world premiere by the San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, in concerts scheduled for March 4, 5, 6 and 7at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.\n\n Kissine, who currently makes his home in Belgium where he is a Professor of Music at two of its important conservatories, writes that he was a student at the Leningrad Conservatory when he first discovered Ives' piece. Considering it a \"revelation,\" he assiduously studied the details of its score, noting that Ives utilized a trumpet to repeatedly intone his so-called \"Perennial Question of Existence.\" The piece continues as a series of other instruments offer comments on his question, but cannot \"answer\" it.\n\n In his *Post-scriptum* Kissine engages a series of five different sounds, each of which evolves into either a major or minor pitch interval of a third to deal with \"the question.\"\n\n During our recent e-mail exchange, I asked Kissine if, in his judgment, an average listener would consider his music in general, and *Post-scriptum* in particular, to be \"beautiful,\" \"pleasing,\" \"interesting\" or \"shocking\" following a first hearing.\n\n He replied, \"If the listener finds my music 'beautiful,' I'd be overjoyed. I have nothing against 'pleasing' or 'interesting,' but if he is 'shocked,' I'd be disappointed, because this wasn't my intention at all.\"\n\n Kissine has written a great deal of film music, as well as both chamber and orchestral music during the course of his career. However, his approach to composition departs significantly from the assertive, agitated, and often ear-grating styles issuing from the Fin de Siecle era surrounding the beginning of the 20th century. He explains that his musical language expands to include elements of classical Western-style tonality, 20th century atonality, minimalism, aleatory sounds, and 12-tone techniques, adding that he also utilizes micro-intervals (notes that fall \"between the cracks\" of notes on the piano). Further elaborating on his style, he wrote that beyond the four basic parameters of music - duration, pitch level, intensity, and timbre - there is yet another. This fifth parameter, he asserts, is silence, which he uses to great effect in his compositions.\n\n \"Silence,\" he says,\" does not stop the music. It's part of the music. It's the flip side of music. Sound without silence wouldn't exist.\"\n\n In his e-mail, Kissine asserted that he can't imagine being anything other than a musician and composer. \"I started music when I was five,\" he wrote. \"So, it was the first language I learned to read. And, the first score I sight-read by myself was *Sonata quasi una Fantasia*, Op. 27, No. 2 by Beethoven (the famous \"Moonlight Sonata\"). I remember having had enormous problems with the left hand octaves.\"\n\n Since his family lived near the Philharmonic Hall in Leningrad, he was taken to musical performances from a very early age. \"I especially remember a recital by Sviatislav Richter which made a great impression me,\" he wrote. \"He was playing 'my' Beethoven sonata!\"\n\n He is the father of a boy and a girl and has a four -year-old grandchild. Kissine, now a citizen of Belgium, lives with his wife in Court-Saint-Etienne, a suburb of Brussels.\n\n*\n\nVictor Kissine and his wife backstage with Cheryl North at Davies Hall following the\nworld premiere of Post-scriptum*,\n which received rave reviews in San Francisco\nand subsequently in New York following the San Francisco Symphony performance\n of the work at Carnegie Hall\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Lang Lang prior to his performance at the Opening Concert of the San Francisco Symphony, September 9, 2009**\n\n*Material from the Classical Music Column for the September 4, 2009 Preview Section, Bay Area News Group, under the headlines, \"Lang Lang, man of contrasts, opens S.F. Symphony season\" and \"Lang Lang not fazed by Prokofiev's 3rd.\"*\n\nIf Roman philosopher Seneca's assertion that \"art imitates nature\" (or life) is true, then one could be well on the way to understanding the sometimes startling extremes in Chinese pianist Lang Lang's piano playing.\n\nAt 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, Lang will be welcomed on San Francisco's Davies Hall stage to perform Sergei Prokofiev's thrilling Piano Concerto No. 3 under the baton of Maestro Michael Tilson Thomas for the San Francisco Symphony's 2009-2010 season-opening gala. Additional works on the program will be Liszt's *Mephisto Waltz No. 1,* Ravel's *La Valse* and Richard Rodgers' *Carousel* Waltz.\n\nNow arguably one of the greatest pianists of his generation, Lang is welcomed on the world's most prestigious stages, where he routinely performs with its most renowned orchestras and conductors. In 2008 he not only played for a worldwide audience at the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics, he also played with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock at the Grammy Awards.\n\n*\n\n(Photo by Warner North of Cheryl North and Lang Lang immediately following his performance September 9, backstage at Davies Hall, San Francisco)\n\nBorn in 1982 in the small industrial city of Shenyang in northern China, Lang Lang (his family and given names are the same in English, but slightly different in Chinese) is the only child of victims of the Chinese government's Cultural Revolution. His father, a talented performer on the Chinese erhu, spent $300, half of his yearly salary, to buy a piano for his gifted toddler. His mother played classical music for him when he was still in her womb.\n\n![](/images/lang-lang-mother.jpg)\n\n(Photo by Warner North of Cheryl North and Lang Lang's mother, following the performance September 9, backstage at Davies Hall, San Francisco)\n\nWhen he was 8, his father took him to live in Beijing so that he could study piano at one of the city's best schools. While there, father and son lived in utter poverty, supported only by the mother's earnings back in Shenyang as a telephone operator. Father Lang Guoren would pedal his young son on the back of his rickety bicycle many miles to and from his piano lessons.\n\nLang's piano performance style brims with stark contrasts. His admirers feel obliged to summon up the most superlative adjectives to describe his Olympian digital dexterity and mature musical sensitivity. But his detractors have used words like \"melodramatic\" and \"immature\" to describe his extravagant performance mannerisms. Some have nicknamed him Bang Bang. One of his first teachers in Beijing scoffed, \"You play like a potato farmer.\"\n\nSuch carps have been countered by a prominent U.S. critic's comment, \"Lang's interpretations aren't just expressions of feeling, but are the feelings themselves.\" Even the great American conductor Daniel Barenboim has joked, \"He (Lang Lang) has 11 fingers.\" Another prominent critic has asserted that Lang's virtuosity and charisma have characteristics that range somewhere between Romantic composer/ pianist Franz Liszt and 21st-century rock star Bono of U2.\n\nAcknowledging his dramatic performance tendencies, Lang blames it all on the music itself. \"When you play a piece of great music,\" he said, \"you are not you anymore. You are totally into the world of its composer's mind.\"\n\nAlthough it was 1:05 p.m. in the Bay Area when my telephone interview with Lang began, it was 10:05 p.m. in Germany, where he had just finished a performance of Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2. Nonetheless, he was affable and expansive in his responses to my questions.\n\nExplaining the two \"Langs\" in his name, he said, \"Each Lang means something different in Chinese. The first means 'gentleman'; the second, 'bright.'\"\n\nHe expressed his delight in playing once again with Tilson Thomas and the S.F. Symphony, avowing that under his baton, \"the orchestra has become one of the very best in the world. And besides, the San Francisco Bay Area audiences have always been incredibly supportive of me.\"\n\nAbout the Prokofiev 3rd Piano Concerto, he said, \"It's an easy piece for audiences to understand. In difficulty, it measures about a two or three on a scale of five \"... but it has one of the most exciting finales in all of music.\"\n\nOf course, as most musicians consider the Prokofiev 3rd to be excruciatingly difficult, I felt compelled to ask Lang just which concerto he would consider to be a level 5. \"The Rachmaninoff 3rd,\" he said without the slightest hesitation.\n\nHe revealed that one of his favorite works to play for his own enjoyment when he is alone is J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations.* When Lang is not involved with the piano, he likes reading and admits to being a \"huge sportsman,\" noting that he admires Chinese basketball ace Yao Ming and roots for any team that hails from Philadelphia, where he attended the Curtis School of Music.\n\nAnd what sort of epitaph does he hope to have after he's lived to a ripe old age?\n\n\"I would like to be known for encouraging young children throughout the world to study great classical music,\" he answered. Last year he made a couple of giant steps toward this goal when he launched the Lang Lang International Music Foundation in New York and became the youngest person appointed as the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Lorraine Hunt Lieberson**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for June 11, 2004\n*\n\nDuring a telephone interview a couple of years ago, mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, now extravagantly praised for her vocal performances throughout the world, revealed that it was not her voice that initially propelled her into a musical career, but rather, the viola.\n\nRaised in the San Francisco Bay Area, she participated in all the local youth symphonies, including the Oakland Symphony Youth Orchestra under the directorship of Robert Hughes and later, Dennis DeCoteau.\n\nShe lived in San Mateo until she was in fourth grade and then moved with her family to Orinda.\n\n\"Both my parents were musical,\" she said, ``and I was given piano lessons when I was very young. Then came the violin and eventually, the viola.\"\n\nWhile in Orinda, she attended Campolindo High School where she continued her musical studies and sang in the school chorus. She moved to Berkeley for her last high school year, where she took full advantage of what she termed \"Berkeley High School's incredible music department.\"\n\n*\n\nEventually she enrolled in the music department at San Jose State University where she undertook a double major in both voice and viola. \"That's where I met the well-known Bay Area cellist, Emil Miland,\" she recalled. \"We car-pooled down to San Jose together.\"\n\nSoon after, she joined the San Jose Symphony under George Cleve and for the next six years, concentrated on the viola. Singing was put in the background. Then, she recalled, \"I sang in the Metropolitan Opera auditions in San Francisco and made the finals. After that I was really excited about singing again.\"\n\nShe stressed however, that her decision to go into singing professionally did not come about overnight.\n\n\"It happened very gradually, quite naturally, in fact. There were a lot of encouragements along the way, but no individual, earth-shaking event that made me change,\" she said. \"But, back in 1988, when my viola was stolen, I took that as a sort of omen.\"\n\nShe travelled to Boston, began study with Delores Leffingwell, and as a result was accepted into a two-year opera program at the Boston Conservatory. She has since won fame and acclaim for the unusually broad repertoire that encompasses everything from Baroque to contemporary music. The beauty of her voice, as well as her exceptional musicianship have earned her leading roles in the European premiere of John Adams' El Nino* at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris earlier this Spring, as well as its original World Premiere in San Francisco a couple of years ago.\n\nDuring the coming months, she will not only sing the eloquent mezzo solo in Mahler's *2nd Symphony* with the San Francisco Symphony during concerts the next two weeks, she will also sing it in Boston later in the year. In addition, she will sing with Emmanuel Music as it tours through the United States and Europe with a semi-staged work based on J.S. Bach Cantatas and staged by Peter Sellars. There will also be recitals in Berkeley and at New York City's Lincoln Center in its upcoming \"Art of Song\" series. And besides all of that, she just recorded a CD of Schumann's 19th century Lieder with pianist Peter Serkin for Koch Classics.\n\nLast year she sang such diverse roles as Myrtle Wilson for the World Premiere of John Harbison's contemporary opera, *The Great Gatsby*;\" the lead role in Bizet's *Carmen*\" for the Met's Millennium Gala; Handel arias with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and the lead in her husband Peter Lieberson's new opera, *Ashoka's Dream*, with the the Santa Fe Opera.\n\nAnd although she hasn't yet replaced her stolen viola when I spoke to her, she avowed that \"the viola is always with me in spirit when I sing.\"\n\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n\n### Cheryl North Interviews Frank Lopardo**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column for September 21, 2001\n*\n\nFrank Lopardo is a tenor with both sense and sensibility -- a combination somewhat rare among the breed. His portrayal of the Duke of Mantua in the San Francisco Opera's current production of Verdi's *Rigoletto* shows off his mellifluous yet powerful voice, as well as his finely tuned musicianship.\n\nIn his earlier years on the operatic stage, while singing a great deal of Mozart and Rossini, his voice was much lighter and lacked the heft it has today.\n\nIn a one of his rarely given interviews last week, the 43-year-old tenor explained that his clarion high notes and resonant power are not because he is doing anything special or singing in a different way than he did earlier in his career.\n\n\"It's all happened quite naturally -- possibly because of increasing age and because of years of healthy singing. I still study with the same teacher, Robert White, and maintain the same practice routine as I did when I started singing opera back in the early 1980s.\"\n\nHandsome, fit, and finely featured, Lopardo had no intention of becoming an opera singer during his childhood years in Queens, New York. Neither his mother, whose family had immigrated to the United States from Northern Italy, nor his father, whose roots were in Salerno, Italy, was musical.\n\n \"I wasn't much of an athlete and didn't have much to do with music when I turned 12. I just wanted to survive,\" he said with a sigh and a chuckle.\n\n\"Then, when I got into high school, I sang in the chorus of our school production of *Fiddler on the Roof*. Some of the people who heard me suggested that I audition for a part in our community theater.\"\n\nHe landed a few parts and found that he really liked singing. With the idea that he might pursue a career singing in Broadway-style musicals, he entered Queens College intending to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in music. \"At that age, opera wasn't high on my priority list,\" he said.\n\nBut faculty members recognized the possibilities inherent in his luminous voice and his extraordinary musicianship, and urged him to try some opera. Although he claims that there was no decisive moment for his decision to go into operatic singing, he was nevertheless hooked on the art form. He auditioned and was accepted at Juilliard School of Music and began studying with White.\n\n\"Now I really feel at home in the classical music world,\" he said. \"I can't imagine doing anything else -- but in my old age, I hope to go back to doing some painting and sculpting and a lot of reading.\"\n\nAlthough Lopardo's voice can soar skyward with stunning high C's, his common sense keeps him with feet firmly on the ground. He is definitely NOT a temperamental prima donna-type.\n\nWhen I mentioned that some of his local musical colleagues had told me about his good nature and easy sense of humor during the recent *Rigoletto* preparations, he modestly replied, \"I've been known to keep things light during rehearsals.\"\n\nContinuing, he emphasized, \"I try not to bring too much attention to myself during rehearsals and to just do my job. It takes a lot of hard work to really do justice to a particular role. I can't waste my energies trying to become a famous household name.\"\n\nWhen I asked him what he would like to be doing 15 or 20 years from now, he spontaneously said, \"Just what I'm doing now. I love the repertoire I'm presently doing -- *La Boheme, Traviata, Lucia, L'Elisir, Eugene Onegin, Rigoletto *. But I want to explore them more fully. Just because you've got a role memorized, doesn't mean that you've uncovered all its secrets. I'll always be searching for more nuance and polish to bring to the roles I'm now singing.\" However, he added that he hopes to add the lead tenor roles of *Werther, Manon* and *Tales of Hoffman*, even though he qualified these plans with the comment \"Life is short. Why should I do what I don't particularly like when I am quite happy doing the roles that resonate with me?\"\n\n![](/images/frank-lopardo.jpg)\n\nAnother indication of what many in the music world would consider this uncommon tenor's common sense, is the fact that he doesn't read reviews until a particular engagement is over.\n\n\"You can get seduced by the good ones and depressed by the bad ones. I think its best to simply compile them and read them when you've finished a particular role -- or in your old age,\" he quipped.\n\nThe only thing about his operatic success that gives him the least bit of pause is that it keeps him away from his home and family in New York _ his school-teacher wife and two sons, 12 and 15 years of age -- for long blocks of time.\n\n\"Even though my boys are more interested in MTV than opera, they still come to as many of my performances as they can,\" he said.\n\nLopardo has by now successfully established himself performances of his signature repertoire in most of the major opera houses of the world, such as the London Royal Opera, the Bavarian State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Santa Fe, the Paris Opera/Bastille, and well as on many CD and video recordings.\n\nBut, don't expect him to be singing Wagner any time soon!\n\n\n",

Admittedly hungry after the performance, he launched into the Chinese delicacies with gusto, paying special attention to the fortune cookie at the meal's end.\n\n\"It was in a Chinese fortune cookie many years ago that I got some of the best advice of my life,\" he announced. \"It said 'Every great accomplishment is at first impossible.' That was so important to me that I had it framed and mounted on the wall so that I, as well as my visitors and fellow musicians, could see it every day.\"\n\nMasur has indeed been faced with many seemingly impossible situations during his 75 years. When only 17, he was forced by the Nazis to serve in the Wehrmacht for the last three desperate months of World War II.\n\nEver sophisticated and urbane, he did not divulge details at the dinner table, but rather, in a talk the next day to students and faculty at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music during which he explained, \"We (his company of fellow-teenagers) started out 130, and we came back 27. This is not to describe my own fate - I am grateful because I survived - but to describe how deeply I am moved by the *War Requiem*,\" to which he added the conviction that there few real winners in most wars ... only losers.\n\nThere are many other endeavors that reflect his deep devotion to humanity and peace. He used his status as a world-renown artist to help prevent violence in Germany before the Berlin Wall came down, and was subsequently awarded the prestigious \"Cross with Star of the Order of Merits of the Federal Republic of Germany\" by its President Johannes Rau, with the beaming approval of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Such actions have also won him the \"Commander Cross of Merit of the Polish Republic\" from Polish President Aleksander Kwas, and the \"Commander of the Legion of Honor\" title by the government of France. He also has a dozen honorary doctorates to his credit.\n\nMasur was born in the small town of Brieg, Silesia. When he was only five, he was able to go to the piano and perfectly repeat a passage of music with which his older sister had been struggling. He went on to study music at Leipzig's School of Music until the war's outbreak.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his music study and played the string bass with a jazz combo in small clubs at night to support himself.\n\n\"We could play 160 different titles without any music,\" he proudly told his dinner companions Thursday eve.\n\nHis first major musical appointment came in 1955 when he was named conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic. Since then he has risen to the status of one of the world's greatest conductors, presiding over such major orchestras as the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, thus following in the footsteps of Felix Mendelssohn, Artur Nikisch, Kurt Furtwangler, and Bruno Walter; the Cleveland Orchestra; the New York, London, and Israel Philharmonic Orchestras, and as guest conductor for many more. He is presently the music director/conductor of the Orchestre National de France.\n\nIn most of these posts, Masur uniquely distinguished and endeared himself well beyond the expected. He was awarded the first-ever honor of \"Conductor Laureate\" by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra; given the lifetime title of \"Honorary Guest Conductor of the Israel Philharmonic;\" and named \"Music Director Emeritus\" in June, 2002 by the New York Philharmonic, making him the only person other than Leonard Bernstein to receive an honorary title from that organization.\n\nThe New York Philharmonic honor was awarded even though his departure last season as its conductor was neither voluntary nor at the behest of the musicians. NY Concertmaster Glen Dicterow's comments about the orchestra's progress under Masur are quoted in *Musical America* as \"We (the orchestra) listen to each other more, we breathe together, there's an esprit de corps amonsts us. It's just a tighter situation than it once was.\"\n\nIn the same article, Masur is reported to have said, \"They (the orchestra members) understood that all I wanted was to work together for quality, for responsibility toward the composer, for meaningful interpretations. We will miss each other.\"\n\n![](/images/thm-masur.jpg)\n\nHappily, his domestic life is on the idyllic side. Tomoko smilingly relealed, \"We fell in love when he was a guest conductor more than 25 years ago in Brazil and I was one of the violists.\"\n\nAfter a brief courtship, they married and now have a son, Ken David, who is a graduate of Columbia University in New York and now hopes to study voice in Detmold, Germany with Thomas Quasthoff.\n\nThey both described the place they consider home as \"a lovely house with a garden and a fine kitchen in Westchester, New York.\"\n\n\"The kitchen is VERY important to Kurt,\" Tomoko added. \"Sometimes he even works on his musical scores on the kitchen table so he can be with me while I am cooking!\"\n\nOne of Masur's greatest challenges happened last year when a grave kidney condition necessitated a transplant. After a grueling period during which his life consisted of long hours of dialysis broken only by recesses to the New York Philharmonic podium for rehearsals and performances, his nephew volunteered to donate a kidney. The match was perfect -- and within weeks Masur, standing straight and tall (although with telling lines added to his face), was back to podium.\n\n\"It seems impossible -- like a miracle -- that he as recovered so well,\" Tomoko said.\n\nThen someone on the other side of the table broke open one of the fortune cookies and waved its little fortune in the air. Looking at the Maestro, the rest of the guests smiled and he nodded in ascent.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n*\n**\n\nCheryl North Interviews Michael Tilson Thomas**\n\nBay Area News Group Preview Section Classical Music Column*, also posted on *Inside Bay Area* Web site, September 12, 2008, under headline,**\n\"Links to Leonard Bernsteing bring Michael Tilson Thomas to Carnegie Hall\"**\n\nWhy would the management of New York's Carnegie Hall look all the way across the United States to San Francisco to fill the niche for its upcoming opening night gala commemorating the 90th anniversary of Leonard Bernstein's birth?\n\nBecause the Bay Area's maestro Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony are arguably the best qualified in the country to do the job. MTT, as Thomas is popularly known, is likely the artist most deeply influenced by, as well as possibly the foremost interpreter of, the music of the late great Bernstein.\n\nFortunately, we in the Bay Area will be treated to a home-town preview of the New York City program right here at Davies Symphony Hall next week. Works scheduled on both programs will include selections from Bernstein's operas, ballets, music theater productions and his Mass.\n\nSimilarities between Bernstein and MTT abound. To begin with, they share a deep ethnic commonality. Bernstein, born in Lawrence, Mass., descends from a Polish-Jewish family from the Ukraine, whereas the Los Angeles-born Thomas, 63, descends from the Thomashefskys, a Russian-Jewish family.\n\nMuch in common\n\nClose friends until Bernstein's death in 1990, both were/are accomplished concert-level pianists as well as conductors and composers. Both shared a musical curiosity reaching through centuries of history into the present time. MTT as well as Bernstein possessed an almost clairvoyant affinity for the music of Gustav Mahler, and both have championed his works with preeminent recordings and concerts.\n\nInterestingly, both had similar launches into the galaxy of musical stardom. Bernstein's catapult to the musical cosmos came in November 1943, when Bruno Walter, then the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, suddenly took ill. Bernstein, the orchestra's 25-year-old assistant conductor, was tapped to take Walter's place at the podium. His performance was so brilliant that he literally became an overnight sensation.\n\nMTT's big night came a generation later, just shortly before his own 25th birthday. He, too, was an assistant conductor (of the Boston Symphony), when conductor William Steinberg suddenly took ill. MTT was asked to rescue the performance, which he likewise accomplished brilliantly.\n\nBoth gentlemen have been described as \"fierce\" advocates of multimedia music education. Whereas Bernstein was a media pioneer promoting classical music education with such ground-breaking television shows as \"Omnibus\" and in his innovative educational commentaries during his New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts, MTT's more technologically sophisticated media excursions have included his own multimedia project, \"Keeping Score,\" in addition to a nationally syndicated radio series on avant-garde American composers called \"American Mavericks\"; an award-winning children's Web site at [www.sfkids.org](http://www.sfkids.org); and the nationally acclaimed \"Adventures in Music\" education program in San Francisco schools.\n\nMTT generously took a few minutes from his frenetic 2008-2009 season-opening rehearsals and concerts last week to share some of his thoughts on Bernstein via telephone. He recounted a recent conversation he'd had at the gym where he works out.\n\nA familiar 'Story'\n\n \"I asked one of my trainers about his favorite Broadway shows,\" said MTT. \"He didn't show much enthusiasm, until I mentioned 'West Side Story.' Then his face lit up with recognition. Like a majority of us, he knew, liked, and could instantly relate to 'West Side Story.'\"\n\n According to MTT, the name Leonard Bernstein holds an indelible place within the musical memories of those whose lifetimes trace back through the America of the 1940s, '50s and '60s.\n\n\"Leonard Bernstein created a tradition in American music of which we are all a part — whether we know it or not. Almost everyone alive today has been influenced in some way by his music,\" said Tilson Thomas.\n\nWhen I asked if he could compare Bernstein's compositions to those of any other 20th century composers, he demurred. \"Perhaps Gershwin,\" he said cautiously. \"But the whole point about Bernstein is that he moved into new categories. The nature of the materials he used reflected jazz and music theater as well as the symphonic tradition.\"\n\nIn a previous interview by Synneve Carlino for the upcoming Carnegie Hall program, MTT explained further: \"Over the course of time, it may be that the language of his music might become more remote from audiences, but I think there will still be a certain kind of heart inside of it that will always be recognized as symbolizing a particular period in the United States, when people were very confident and very generous \"... To me, he represents someone from the generation of young victors of the Second World War.\"\n\nThe official Bernstein Web site goes even further: \"The example of his (Bernstein's) thrilling, turbulent and generous life seems nothing less than the American dream come true.\"\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - February 27, 2004*, under headline,\n\n **\"Tilson Thomas celebrates 10th anniversary with Symphony\"**\n\nTHE collaboration between conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony\nis a music lovers' dream come true.\n\nTen years ago, when MTT assumed the post of music director\nof the San Francisco Symphony, he knew he was in for something special. (\"MTT\" is the nickname\naffectionately bestowed upon the maestro by his Bay Area audiences).\n\n\"I expected I was in for a very exhilarating, no-holds-barred, time,\" he said during a\ntelephone interview. \"That expectation has been absolutely realized.\"\n\nMilestones of the MTT and SFS collaboration include the commissioning of 20 new works\nand a number of fresh new insights into masterpieces from the past. There have been four\nGrammy Awards, nine acclaimed recordings on the BMG label, and the birth of SFS's own\nrecording organization with the stated goal of committing to disc all nine Mahler symphonies\n\n![](/images/mtt.jpg)\n\nover a five-year period (Six and Three have already garnered Grammies).\nAnd, perhaps best of all, the San Francisco Symphony, under MTT's guidance, has won worldwide\nrecognition. It is often placed by critics among the world's top five orchestras.\n\nThe maestro's gentlemanly diffidence, as well as his unabashed musical genius, has\ncontributed much to the decade's successes. A couple of times during the press conference\nto announce the Symphony's upcoming season, he made sure to emphasize that these are not \"his\"\nperformances. \"No, no -- these are all performances by members of the orcheatra, not by me,\"\nhe stressed. \"They are representations of many shared hours of collaboration between us all.\nThat's the real nature of the relationship the orchestra and I are trying to build.\"\nHe then noted that visiting conductors have more than once said things to him like,\n\"This is extraordinary -- that you and the orchestra members are getting along so well after\nall these years.\"\n\nFortunately, according to MTT, there's more of the same in the foreseeable future. \"I plan\nto stay right here (leading the SFS) for my day job,\" he said. Then, jesting, he continued,\n\"Oh, maybe I'll try out to be a celebrity chef on 'The Iron Chef' TV program, or something\nlike that on the side. But there's much more to be done musically right where I am.\"\n\nPlans are in the works for an exciting 2004-2005 SFS season, its 93rd, which also happens\nto be MTT's 10th on its podium. There will not only be reprises of several of the MTT/SFS\n\"Greatest Hits\" of the past decade, but also at least a quarter of the season's scheduled works\nwill be new to local subscription audiences. Among the past greats will be Stravinsky's\n\"Rite of Spring\" music, Copland's \"Orchestral Variations,\" Mahler's Symphony No. 9, and\nselections from Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet.\" The season's grand finale will be a performance\nof Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.\n\nTwo world premieres -- a Rhapsody for English Horn, composed by Berkeley's John Thow in\nhonor of SFS English horn player Julie Ann Giacobassi, and a new commission to William Kraft\nto feature SFS timpanist David Herbert in a concerto -- will keep local ears tuned in. Among\nthe other relatively unfamiliar contemporary compositions animating the season ahead will be\nworks by Oliver Knussen, Alfred Schnittke, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Robin Holloway, Steve Reich\nand John Adams.\n\nA work called \"Three Screaming Popes\" written by Mark-Anthony Turnage, jolted my sensibilities.\n\"What kind of piece is that?\" I asked MTT.\n\n\"Oh, it's based on Francis Bacon's painting named 'Three Screaming Popes,'\" he explained.\nAnd, ever the educator, he quickly clarified that Bacon was a 20th century abstract painter.\n\nAmong the vaunted \"war horses\" included in upcoming programs are Beethoven's Opus 61 Violin\nConcerto with Midori as soloist, Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist in a performance of Rachmaninoff's\npulse-pounding Piano Concerto No. 2, and Britten's Double Concerto in B Minor featuring SFS\nconcertmaster Alexander Barantschik on violin and popular principal violist Geraldine Walther.\nOther stars in the SFS firmament will be Joshua Bell in a performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin\nConcerto, Barantschik staring both as soloist and conductor in selected Brandenburg Concerti by\nJ.S. Bach, as well as significant forays into the music of Debussy, Bartok, Richard Strauss,\nRavel, Schoenberg, Schnittke, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Bruckner, Berio, Bernstein, Hayden,\nDvorak and more.\n\nUnusual among the coming attractions, both involving world-class vocal soloists and the\nGrammy-winning San Francisco Symphony Chorus under Vance George, will be Janacek's \"Glagolitic Mass\"\nand Robert Schumann's obscure \"Das Paradies und die Peri.\"\n\nThe new season also includes MTT's 60th birthday, with a gala, star-studded musical celebration\nscheduled for Jan. 13.\n\nMTT is an uncharacteristically youthful 60 -- slim and lithe as a dancer with salt and pepper\nhair that often falls boyishly over his forehead. He attributes his youthful demeanor to \"spending\nhours waving arms in front of the orchestra most days, climbing a lot of stairs, and walking my\nbeloved dog Sheynah up and down San Francisco's hills.\"\n\nEven though he can be theatrical and can quite effectively lapse into a foreign accent to amuse\nor to make a point, he is most often soft-spoken, direct and sincere. However, when he talks\nspecifically about music and its significance his eyes assume a laser intensity and he commands\nrapt attention. So, MTT, SFS and audiences across the Bay and the world, can expect more good years\nand high musical times together.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Kent Nagano**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column - August 31, 2001*\n\nThe conductor of the prestigious Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin as well as the Associate Principal Guest Conductor of the London Symphony,and the Principal Guest Conductor of the Los Angeles Opera will conduct the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra when it opens its 2001-2002 season on September 24.\n\nJust HOW did the modestly sized, and even more modestly funded, BSO land such a milestone musical coup?\n\nThe quite wonderful answer is simply that Berkeley has the fervent devotion of Kent Nagano, one of the world's leading conductors - and it is Nagano, this single individual, who holds all of the above-named positions, along with the artistic leadership of the Berkeley Symphony. Moreover, this idyllic union between Nagano and the Berkeley orchestra has endured since 1979!\n\nA third-generation Californian, Nagano was only 27 when he first assumed leadership of the Berkeley Symphony. The son of Japanese-American parents, he grew up on a farm in Morro Bay and was educated in both Japanese and Western traditions. His architect father and pianist mother saw to it that their son was at ease in both the visual and the performing arts. He was playing the piano by the time he was four years old, and by his mid-teens, was accomplished on both the viola and the clarinet.\n\nHe attended local public schools during his early youth and went on to earn a B.A. degree from the University of California at Santa Cruz and an M.A. in music from San Francisco State University. In subsequent years he studied conducting with Seiji Ozawa, Pierre Boulez, Leonard Bernstein, Bernard Haitink, and Claudio Abbado. He also led both England's famed Halle Orchestra as well as the Opera de Lyon in France for nine years each.\n\n*\n\nHis first taste of worldwide recognition came back in 1984 when he conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in a critically acclaimed performance of Mahler's great Symphony No. 9* on a single day's notice!\n\nSince then he has garnered honors for three Grammy Awards and three Grand Prix du Disque awards for his recordings with leading orchestras and opera companies and has earned the admiration of the entire classical musical world. In addition, he has been happily married for a number of years to Mari Kodama, the elegantly beautiful Osaka-born, European-bred and educated concert pianist.\n\nYears and fame have not changed Nagano's modest, easy-going nature. During an interview last week he was just as approachable as I remember him to have been more than a decade ago, when he took time from his busy schedule to meet with one of his young cousin's elementary school classes in north Fremont.\n\nWhen I reminded him of that occasion, he emphasized the importance of one's early musical experiences. \"When I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, the California school system was really exemplary,\" he said. \"Especially in the Morro Bay schools, the education budget at that time allowed for all sorts of visionary projects.\"\n\nHe explained that he owed much of his love for music to a particular teacher in that district, Wachtag Korisheli. \"Mr. Korisheli was born in the Republic of Georgia in the former Soviet Union,\" Nagano explained. \"After an extensive musical education in Georgia and later in Munich, Germany, he immigrated to the United States. He chose to be a teacher and his first teaching happened to be in the Morro Bay Elementary School.\"\n\n\"We as children just fell in love with him,\" Nagano continued. \"He established a sort of conservatory system and taught each of us personally. We would begin at 7 a.m., before regular classes, and often continue with more music after school. Eventually we had three concert bands and two orchestras in our little school!\"\n\nSo what keeps this powerhouse of world music coming back to lead the Berkeley Symphony year after year? \"I love Berkeley,\" Nagano said during the telephone conversation he managed to sandwich between rehearsals of *Lohengrin* with Maximilian Schell for the Los Angeles Opera last week. \"I feel a closeness with the orchestra as well as the whole community of Berkeley. For its size, Berkeley is especially rich in terms of intellectual and artistic achievement - and as a community, it has always been in a charismatic leadership role for social change. There's a very special collective personality and character in Berkeley.\"\n\n\"Many of the orchestra members have been with me since I began in '79,\"he continued. \"And the audience is unusually receptive to new and adventurous programming as well as in the more traditional classics. And besides, there are all sorts of Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, and more - who tuck themselves quietly away, without any limelight, in the audience.\"\n\nAs a result, BSO has come to be known for its performances of new and/or unusual music, often presented in unique ways. During his years with the orchestra, Nagano has performed a number of masterworks from the pen of Olivier Messiaen, who on several occasions personally attended the concerts. In addition, Nagano often takes up the microphone himself to introduce and explain the music to his dependably receptive audience. \"I try to invite them to participate in an atmosphere of sharing - to join with us in our moments of discovery,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about BSO's upcoming season, with its strong emphasis on the music of Franz Schubert, Nagano explained that he has recently been involved in performances of Schubert cycles in Paris, Berlin and Vienna. \"While most musical people are familiar with Schubert's songs, his orchestral music is very under appreciated,\" he said. \"Therefore, I've included a Schubert orchestral work, alongside a number of other classics and new works that I consider to be related, on every one of the four Berkeley Symphony Programs.\"\n\nThe Orchestra's opening program, scheduled for 8 p.m. Sept. 24 at Hertz Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, will combine Schubert's *Symphony No. 6* with Beethoven's *Coriolan Overture*; the local premiere of Richard Felciano's *Camp Songs*; and the world premiere's of Regis Campo's *Lumen* and Daniel Brewbaker's *Piano Concerto No. 2* with Jerry Kuderna as soloist.\n\nSubsequent concerts throughout the year will include Schubert's *Symphonies No. 3 and 5* and his *Rosamunde Overture *alongside works by Arnold Schoenberg, Gustav Mahler, Ichiro Nodaira, David Sheinfeld, Karen Lakey Buckwalter, Pierre Boulez, Zdzislaw Wysocki, and Anton Bruckner.\n\n\"These musical combinations invite people to make connections - to draw lines from one piece of music to another and to understand how they are related,\" Maestro Nagano enthusiastically explained. \"And one can do this especially well in Berkeley!\"\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\nCheryl North Interviews Constantine Orbelian**\n\nANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - February 7, 2003.*\n\nImagine the following scenario for a terrific movie: A young American concert pianist arrives in cold blustery Moscow on a December day in 1990 to begin rehearsing for his upcoming appearance with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra. He is primed and ready to solo in the daunting Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 1.\n\nThen, the conductor of the orchestra suddenly takes ill. He dies.\n\n*\n\nThe concert is to be canceled. But, like the coming of the cavalry to save the besieged fort, the young American suggests that he can not only play the scheduled Shostakovich Concerto, he can also wield a baton! Like John Wayne with sword held high rallying the troops, he proposes to play the concerto and conduct the orchestra too. They doubt, of course. But after he displays his prowess during a rehearsal, they decide they must allow him to try.\n\nThe big night arrives. He swashbuckles through the performance in heroic fashion. The concert is a smashing success! They ask him to stay on as their new leader. Cut to the credits.\n\nBut wait! This is not a movie scenario. It's real life -- and it actually happened to conductor/pianist Constantine Orbelian.\n\nOrbelian will be right here in San Francisco to play a piano concerto and conduct a concert with his Moscow Chamber Orchestra at 8 p.m. Tuesday at Herbst Theatre, 401 Van Ness Ave.\n\nI had a chance a while back to interview the congenial Orbelian in a breeze way adjacent to the glorious Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow Conservatory of Music a while back.\n\n![](/images/moscow.jpg)\n\nAn hour or so before our chat, Orbelian had been on the hall's podium to conduct the chorus in which I was singing and had proceeded to surprise my fellow singers with his impeccable, idiomatic English. Although he looked like everybody's idea of a classic Russian -- a sturdy, stocky bear of a man with a coal-black beard and moustache and intense dark eyes -- he sounded as thoroughly American as hot dogs and baseball.\n\nOrbelian was actually born in San Francisco in 1956. His Armenian father, Harry, and his Russian mother, Vera, came to San Francisco from the former Soviet Union shortly after World War II. Papa Orbelian rose from his first job as a janitor at Gumps, to become the venerable company's general manager. Long active in the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, he has headed its Global Trade Council. Mrs. Orbelian, a respected gynecologist, continues her medical work at UC Medical Center in heart and cancer research.\n\nThoroughly American Constantine was early identified as musically gifted and was sent to study at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. His progress was so rapid that he made his piano debut with the San Francisco Symphony at age 11. He continued his education at the prestigious Juilliard School of Music in New York City where, by 1980, he had earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in music.\nSoon signed up by Columbia Artists, he performed throughout the world for the next 10 years as a concert pianist, earning critical acclaim from London's The Guardian* for his \"buoyant, brilliantly detailed and effortlessly agile\" performances, while the music magazine *Ovation* lauded his \"impressive power and sweep.\"\n\nA spate of engagements ensued for the next few years that included performances with the Boston, Detroit, Moscow State and St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestras, the Moscow Philharmonic, the Helsinki Radio Symphony Orchestra, and more. He collaborated with conductors Valery Gergiev, Neeme Jarvi, Vassily Sinaisky, Alexander Dmitriev, Vladimir Spivakov and more.\n\nIn addition, his Chandos recording of the Khachaturian Piano Concerto with Maestro Jarvi and the Scottish National Orchestra was awarded the \"Best Concerto of the Year\" award in the U.K. and reaped the rave, \"He simply plays the living daylights out of the concerto, exhibiting finger work of Horowitzian brilliance and unlimited stamina\" from *Stereo Review.* His other concerto recordings are the Tchaikovsky No. 1 with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London, the Shostakovich No. 1, the Bach Concerto in F Minor; the Beethoven No. 1, and many more.\n\nYoung Orbelian's career, it would seem, had reached a stunning summit. But life often takes some unexpected turns. His life actually merged into the incredible \"movie plot\" expounded at the beginning of this column.\n\nNow, 12 years later, the modest, totally unassuming, approachable Orbelian says, \"I was simply in the right place at the right time -- a time when my particular skills were really needed.\"\n\nDuring his tenure with the MCO, he has taken it on to acclaimed performances in such prestigious concert halls as the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam; the Frankfurter *Alte Oper*; the Shauspielhaus in Berlin; the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London; the Salle Pleyel in Paris; Carnegie Hall in New York; Suntory Hall in Tokyo; and on frequent tours through the United States.\n\nOrbelian's star is still rising. This past year, he was signed on as the new conductor of Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. It could signal a sea change for Russia's post-Soviet musical organizations.\n\nMost orchestral musicians in present-day Russia are paid less than the equivalent of $100 a month -- and there are no extant musicians' unions to ensure reasonable hours or working conditions. Patronage from the nobility during the 18th and 19th centuries and government subsidies during Communist times supported musicians in the past. Not only were the musical organizations well-funded, gifted music students were customarily given full support as well. These sources have now evaporated, so present day Russian music must rely on ticket sales and some modest help from the Russian Federation's Ministry of Culture (comparable to the National Endowment for the Arts in the USA) for sustenance.\n\nRussian eyes are now focused hopefully on Orbelian to bring his American know-how and sense of fair play to Russia's struggling, but phenomenally gifted and well-trained musical community.\n\nMuch is already in motion. With his Russian-born violinist wife, Maria Safarrantz, Orbelian has founded two unique music festivals in Russia -- the Palaces of St. Petersburg International Chamber Music and Choir Festival, which includes 30 concerts in the city's most beautiful and extraordinary Czarist residences, and a new series, Musical Treasures at the Museums of the Kremlin. scheduled in Moscow beginning in April.\n\nTuesday's local concert will include not only Orbelian performing as soloist in the virtuosic *Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra* by Schnittke, but the San Francisco debut of Alexander Markov, the recent gold medal winner of the Paganini International Violin Competition. Markov will be the soloist in the Waxman arrangement of Bizet's Themes from *Carmen*.\n\nOther works on the program will be *Three Armenian Dances* by Komitas; *Five Preludes* by Shostakovich; and Boccherini's *Symphony in D Minor*, subtitled *La Casa del Diavolo*.\n\n©1999-2002 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Cheryl North Interviews Patricia Racette, who sings all three roles in Puccini's *Il Trittico* with the San Francisco Opera, September 2009**\n\nMaterial from the Classical Music Column September 16, 2009 Preview Section, Bay Area News Group, under the headline, \"Racette makes a lifelong run with Puccini's *Senza Mama*.\"\n\nby Cheryl North\n\nHave you ever had a melody that you just can't seem to get out of your head? Sometimes it goes away, but it can become so much a part of you that it keeps coming back, often at quite unexpected moments.\n\nPatricia Racette, the Hollywood-beautiful, vivacious lyric spinto soprano in her ongoing triple-play turn with the San Francisco Opera's production of Puccini's *Il Trittico*, has a unique melody that keeps recurring, not just in her head, but at important junctures in her life. She revealed the rather amazing tale of her relationship with this tune during an interview at the War Memorial Opera House last week\n\nActually, it's not just a \"tune,\" but an especially affecting Puccini aria: *Senza mamma*, from his *Suor Angelica*. She takes on the herculean task of singing the soprano leads in all three operas that comprise *Il Trittico* for six performances, opening Tuesday and continuing tonight through Oct. 3.\n\nWhen I expressed surprise that she would even consider such a daunting project, she chuckled and said, \"Oh, that's nothing. Right after we finish here, both the conductor, Patrick Summers, and I must fly to New York and do the same thing at the Met!\"\n\n\"Actually,\" she hastily added, \"it's been one of my great dreams to sing all three *Il Trittico* heroines. My other dream role is to sing the title role in *Tosca*, which I am scheduled to do next year, again under Summers' direction, in Houston.\"\n\nThe three very different one-act operas of *Il Trittico* - *Il Tabarro, Suor Angelica* and *Gianni Schicchi* - are traditionally performed within the same evening, but by three separate casts. *Senza mamma* is the gorgeous aria sung by Sister Angelica, the noble but tragic nun in the second opera. It's a lament for her out-of-wedlock little son, forced to live and finally die without the loving presence of his mother, confined to a convent as punishment for her sin. Hence, the aria's title is \"Without Mama.\"\n\nRacette's first encounter with this poignant aria was in 1984 at North Texas State University, when she was an entering freshman. A native of New Hampshire, she had piled into a bus with her whole family and traveled for three straight days to get to the school, known for its excellent jazz program. Racette was bent on becoming a jazz singer.\n\nAlas, she overslept the morning of her crucial audition and was told she had missed her opportunity to sing in the jazz choir that term. She was directed to the opera class, which still had some openings.\n\nThe bitterly disappointed freshman trudged over to the class and sang for the professor, who realized she had a selling job to do to convince the young jazz buff to give opera a try.\n\nRacette's face lit up with a broad smile as she recalled, \"After telling me that my voice was much better suited to grand opera than to pop or jazz, the professor put on a recording of Italian opera star Renata Scotto singing *Senza mamma*. I was blown away!\" Entranced by the aria, she willingly submitted herself to what was for her a completely unfamiliar art form and earned a bachelor of arts degree in voice. She then headed to New York City for auditions the S.F. Opera's Merola training program was holding there. *Senza mamma* was the piece she chose for her audition. She was quickly accepted into the program and headed off to San Francisco in 1988.\n\nAmong her fellow Merolini that summer was Patrick Summers, who since has become one of her closest friends and collaborators. Racette was chosen to sing the taxing role of Cio-Cio-San, the heroine of Puccini's *Madama Butterfly* for Merola's summer performances at Villa Montalvo, and Summers was to conduct. Since then, the role of vulnerable, determined Butterfly has become one of her signatures in opera houses throughout the world.\nSince her Merola days, she has sung leading roles in such diverse operas as Janacek's *Jenufa* and *Kat'a Kabanova*, Verdi's *Othello* and *La Traviata*, both Mimi and Musetta in Puccini's *La Boheme*, Freia and Helmwige in Wagner's *Ring* cycle and several world premieres of contemporary works throughout the world. She maintains close ties with New York's Metropolitan, Chicago, Santa Fe, Houston, Fort Worth and many European opera companies.\n\nAlthough she calls San Francisco Opera \"my home company,\" she and her life partner, mezzo-soprano Beth Clayton, make their home in Santa Fe.\n\nAh, but there's yet another *Senza mamma* anecdote in Racette's story. Just two years ago, she was chosen to present the *Opera News* magazine award to Renata Scotto. And what was the background music as Scotto accepted the award? A recording of Scotto herself singing *Senza mamma*.\n\n![](/images/racette-c-w-9-15-09.jpg)\n\nCheryl North, Patrica Racette, and\nWarner North, backstage at the\nWar Memorial Opera House,\n September 15, 2009\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### Samuel Ramey Interview\n\n**San Franscisco's Mayor Gives a Day to the Devil - or Rather, the Preeminent Interpreter of Operatic Demons**\n\n*Material from Classical Music Column in the Oakland Tribune, Costra Costa Times, and Inside Bay Area - November 7. 2008*\n\nSubject matter in classical music runs the gamut from saintly to sinful, the sacred to the profane, and all possible gradations between. Examples of this spectrum's extremes will be represented on Bay Area stages during the current fortnight. Subjects sacred will be channeled in several performances of the music of Olivier Messiaen, the deeply spiritual, Catholic composer born in Avignon, France exactly a century ago, while the other extreme will be represented on the San Francisco Opera House stage by the bass, Samuel Ramey.\n\n Ramey, who is in town singing the tormented title role in Mussorgsky's *Boris Godunov* is arguably the world's greatest operatic interpreter of the Devil himself, as well as a number of the other demonic characters that slink and seethe through the operatic repertory.\n\n My personal encounter with the imposing basso was an interview on Oct. 29, the day decreed by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom to be \"Samuel Ramey Day,\" in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of his San Francisco debut.\n\n Tall, fit, and leonine-looking with his luxuriant mane of gray hair and red leather jacket, Ramey said, \"One of the main things I remember about that debut (as Colline in *La Boheme*) was a critic's comment about what a pity it was that I had been forced to wear such an 'unfortunate' wig. But of course, it was actually my own hair!\"\n\n Since then, Ramey has sung with SFO under five consecutive general directors, won three Grammy Awards, a Grand Prix du Disc, the San Francisco Opera's 2003 Gold Medal, and has become the most-recorded operatic bass in history. He has gleaned fame and acclaim for his best-selling recording and concert series titled \"A Date with the Devil\" and claims the role of Mephistopheles in Gounod's *Faust* as his favorite.\n\n When I asked him if he was ever bothered by singing so many devilish characters, he flashed a gleeful grin, and replied, \"The bad guys have all the fun, you know.\"\n\n But, while still maintaining his infectious smile, he affirmed that he sang in his local church choir as a boy in Colby, Kansas and in church while attending Kansas State University in Wichita. Then, as though adding a confirming postscript, he noted that he fondly remembered his mother singing hymns as she went about her housecleaning.\n\n \"I grew up listening to the voices of Sinatra, Pat Boone, and Elvis and never even saw an opera until I was actually in one,\" he explained. But, after a couple of experiences singing in opera choruses in Colorado, he was hooked, and headed for New York City for further vocal study and an audition for the New York City Opera after which he was given the role of Zuniga in *Carmen* and, thenceforward, has made operatic history.\n\n At 66, he is scaling down somewhat from what has customarily been up to 80 performances annually. In his spare time he plays golf, is an avid spectator of basketball and baseball, and enjoys theater, movies, and watching television. He is already on the faculty of Roosevelt University in Chicago, where he plans to spend his eventual retirement years teaching.\n\n As one of his life's happiest occurrences, he lists his marriage to a beautiful blonde soprano named Lindsey, and with her, to have produced a handsome son, now five years old, who looks just like his Papa.\n\nFor a more information (and photos) on a \"Date with the Devil,\" see [Samuel Ramey's website](http://www.samuelramey.com/).\n\n### Samuel Ramey's Devilish Roles\n\n*\n\nAs Mephistopheles in Faust* by Gounod\n\n![](/images/ramey-boito-mephis-florence.jpg)\n\nAs Boito's Mephistopheles\n\n*******\n\n![](/images/sam-and-cherie.jpg)\n\n\"My date with the devil\"- along with 25 or so other people\n\n![](/images/ramey-c-and-w-lunch-08.jpg)\n\nSamuel Ramey, Cheryl North, and Warner North at a lunch hosted by the San Francisco Opera\nPhoto credit: Terrence McCarthy\n (also for Ramey photo on Interviews page)\n\nDevil photos above from Ramey website\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### Celino Romero Interview\n\n**\n\nThird generation of Romero guitar comes to Bay Area**\n\n*San Mateo County Times - July 26, 2002.*\n\nLEGENDARY Spanish guitar master Celedonio Romero certainly knew a great deal about the guitar. But he also knew a thing or two about how to rear a successful, unified family.\n\nWith the help of his wife, Angelita Gallego Romero, he became the patriarch of a very happy clan of musicians currently known as the \"Royal Family of the Guitar.\"\n\nNow, a third-generation Romero, Celino, is preparing to offer Bay Area music lovers a taste of the Romero guitar magic during a concert with the San Francisco Symphony at 8 p.m. Thursday at Davies Symphony Hall, Grove Street and Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco.\n\nMaestro Keith Lockhart will lead the orchestra in a program titled \"Latin Classics,\" featuring Juan Turina's \"Danzas Fantasticas,\" de Falla's Suite from \"The Three-cornered Hat\" and Joaquin Rodrigo's glorious \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" with young Romero as guitar soloist.\nCelino's grandparents, Celedonio and Angelita, relocated their family from Malaga, Spain, to Southern California in 1957. In 1960, Celedonio, already acclaimed as a world-class virtuoso, enlisted his three guitarist sons - Celin, Pepe, and Angel - to join with him in forming \"Los Romeros Guitar Quartet.\"\n\nSince then, the family has earned world acclaim as consummate musicians and has even been awarded a collective knighthood into the \"Order of Isabel la Catolica\" from King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nPapa Celedonio's musical and teaching skills have been passed on not only to his sons, but his grandsons and granddaughters.\nAnd if grandson Celino has his way, this glorious legacy will even extend to the great-grandchildren. Celino, Celin's son, replaced his Uncle Angel in the quartet in 1990 when Angel decided to pursue a solo career.\n\nNow married and living in close proximity to his extended family in Del Mar, congenial Celino is introducing his own two sons to the guitar.\n\n\"I bought my little 1-year-old, Maximino, a tiny little guitar at Costco for $70. He strums it in the relaxed and gentle 'Romero' way, with just the right touch - and with a wonderful smile on his face,\" Celino said during a recent telephone interview.\n\nHis older son, Celedonio IV, at 4, also plays the guitar, but is distracted by such typical boy activities as playing with his Buzz Lightyear toys.\n\n\"I think some of my family's success with music is, indeed, inborn,\" Celino says. \"But, a lot is also because of our approach to teaching. I started playing the guitar at 3, and I would study with everybody in the family. I learned the subtle, 'magic' touches from my grandfather, the flamenco techniques from Uncle Pepe (which he explained as a looser kind of action that results in a 'dirtier,' more earthy sound), and a great deal from my father and other uncles. Then, I learned sightreading from my mother Laurie Romero, a fine soprano. The 'Romero' method is to learn touch, relaxation, and technical exercises first, and then to move on from there.\n\n\"When I was younger,\" he says, \"I would love to play things fast. But my grandfather used to say, 'Playing a piece through one time slowly is better than 100 times fast.\"'\n\nCelino says he was involved in athletics in high school and intended to become a professional soccer player. At Palomar College, he played baseball. And, he confesses, he is still a sports addict.\n\nHe says, \"What I still really love doing is to pack up my cheap Yamaha 'beach guitar' along with my surf board and go down to the beach. Then I spend the whole day, alternating between surfing, practicing my guitar and lying in the sun.\"\n\nAs a teenager, some of his favorite bands were Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. He even played in a few garage bands. But he could never bring himself to take up the electric guitar; instead, amplifying his classical guitar.\n\nAnother third-generation Romero in the quartet is Lito, Angel's son, chosen to step in for Grandfather Celedonio, who died in 1996.\nWhile seven grandchildren play the guitar, others, such as Pepe Jr., have found other vocations. Pepe Jr. has earned a reputation as a guitar maker. Cousin Celino says Pepe Jr. studied guitar making in Europe, especially Germany, and now has a four-year waiting list for his handmade guitars.\n\n\"His guitars can cost $7,000 or more,\" Celino says. \"I don't even have one yet - but I suppose, when I'm ready, I'll get some kind of family discount.\"\n\nAs a member of Los Romeros Guitar Quartet, Celino has been touring for more than 10 years, giving recitals and concerts all over the U.S. and Europe with the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony, the Dallas Symphony and in the Metropolitan Museum Music series in New York City. As a soloist, he has played with major orchestras :in Houston, Dallas, Vermont, east Texas and Utah.\n\nOne of the highlights of his life was in 1996, when he performed the \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" with the Houston Symphony.\n\n\"My dad, Celin, was sitting backstage the whole time, since he was too nervous to watch me from out front,\" he says. \"Then after the concert, he was so excited and proud, that he took me out to dinner - and passed his prized Miguel Rodriguez guitar on to me. It's one of my most precious possessions.\"\n\n'1999-2002 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n\n![](/images/title-gray-romeros.gif)\n\n![](/images/celedonio-romero.jpg)\n\nCeledonio Romero\n\n![](/images/romeros.jpg)\n\n(Back) Celin Romero, Pepe Romero.

Flavor to Berlin Philharmonic***\n\nA few weeks ago I visited Berlin, the edgy, energetic capitol of Germany. Berlin, having survived (sometimes barely) a tumultuous history beginning sometime in the 13th century in a niche between the Havel and the Spree Rivers in north-central Germany, has evolved into a rather unsettlingly angular city. Assertive, sometimes shocking skyscrapers cut into its skies, while thousands of giant dark green Linden trees arrayed in long rows tend to calm its labyrinthine streets.\n\n Ruins of old church towers and cathedrals pose peacefully alongside recent restorations as well as the eye-popping new buildings. People with features and physiques representing gene pools from Nordic, Slavic, Eastern, and Central European countries mingle comfortably with its tall, blond Germanic archetypes in the shops and cafes. Even the genial Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit (pronounced Voverite), has been quoted as saying that \"Berlin is the largest Turkish city outside of Turkey.\"\n\n But there's also a distinctly American, even Bay Area, presence now flowing like a spring of fresh water through the city. Los Angeles-born and Francisco-seasoned Pamela Rosenberg is in residence.\n\n Rosenberg, who finished five lively, sometimes controversial, years as San Francisco Opera's General Director in 2005, is now the \"Intendantin\" (CEO) of Berlin's pride and joy, its legendary Philharmonic Orchestra. As such, she serves alongside its Conductor-in-Chief, Sir Simon Rattle, another scion of English-speaking lands with Bay Area connections.\n\n Since I was alone, and a bit jangled by Berlin's highly complex Teutonic transportation system, she generously sent her orchestra-supplied driver to fetch me for our interview. We drove to her large airy apartment, located in a peaceful, park-like area of the city.\n\n She ushered me into her sitting room, where we were soon joined by the early arrival of her next appointment, the jovial Speight Jenkins, General Manager of the Seattle Opera.\n\n \"Have you noticed, Pamela doesn't have any dark circles under her eyes anymore?\" Jenkins quipped as he settled comfortably into a plush chair.\n\n Indeed, she looked hale, slim, and rested, and brought us big glasses of ice water to help compensate for Berlin's hot, humid weather before telling us about her recent jaunt, along with a number of Bay Area friends, to Amsterdam to attend the European premiere of *Dr. Atomic* by Berkeley's John Adams.\n\n The opera, a commission from the San Francisco Opera at the instigation of Rosenberg, had its world premiere in San Francisco on Oct. 1, 2005.\n\n \"There were 10 performances of the opera during the Holland Festival, and since Sellars and Adams had made huge changes in the second act, the whole thing was much better and tighter than the original. The audience loved it,\" she said, adding rather proudly that it is also scheduled to be performed by the Chicago Opera in December and at the Met several times in 2008.\n\n Then, her startlingly blue eyes seemed to take on extra glints of light as she began to illuminate the plans she and Maestro Rattle had laid for the Philharmonic's upcoming season.\n\n \"We'll celebrate the orchestra's 125th Anniversary during 2007-2008,\" she said. \"Our official theme will deal with the Philharmonic during the Nazi Period. Back in 1933-1935, there were only four Jewish players left in the orchestra - the concertmaster and three other first-chair musicians. With the help of Maestro Wilhelm Furtwangler, they were protected and enabled to flee Germany.\"\n\n \"This Jubilee Year is an appropriate time to tackle this issue,\" she said. \"We've commissioned a special book by Mischa Aster dealing with the orchestra during the Nazi period, as well as a documentary film, and an important exhibition. These will be released during our November Festival.\n\n Rosenberg noted that among those interred in the Theresianstadt concentration camp were such promising composers and musicians as Walter Braunfels, Pavel Haas, and what she described as \"a whole generation of Europe's great musicians.\"\n\n Rosenberg and Rattle are united in sharing goals for upcoming orchestral presentations that will add to the orchestra's efforts to \"create connections between historical epochs, build bridges between varying cultures, and to connect historical retrospectives to the recollection of personal destinies.\"\n\n Another example of this latter goal will be a repeat performance for the season opening on August 25 of Beethoven's *Leonore Overture* - the very work which Franz Wuellner conducted in the old Berlin Philharmonie Hall to open the orchestra's first concert on Oct. 23, 1882. But this time around, the old masterwork will be played along with a new work by contemporary composer Magnus Linberg.\n\n Other such connections of different musical epochs will include juxtapositions of turn-of-the-20th-century works by Gustav Mahler with turn-of-the-21st-century pieces by the Finnish Linberg and the British contemporary composer Thomas Ades, as well as a world premiere of a piece by Christian Jost based Joseph Conrad's novel, *Heart of Darkness*, juxtaposed with British Deryck Cooke's performing version of Mahler's unfinished *10th Symphony*.\n\n Berlin's coming season will also highlight ethnic connections and contrasts with several programs under the title \"Alla turca: a Cultural Dialogue.\" These will bring Turkish music from the time of the 18th century's Suleman the Great together with music concurrently composed under Frederick the Great in Central Europe.\n\n Other Bay Area connections will be made when Maestros Donald Runnicles and Nicola Luisotti, past and future music directors respectively, of the SF Opera, conduct the Berlin Philharmonic next season.\n\n All of the above invoked a bit of d'j' vu taking me back to Rosenberg's first press conference as the new General Director of the San Francisco Opera in January of 2001. This was when she announced plans for her \"Animating Opera\" program, which she described as being designed to \"enable our audiences to see interconnections between life and art\" and to show that the musical arts have \"the potential to make people think and feel more deeply about the human condition.\"\n\n But, with her two sons, a daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren living nearby in Germany, Rosenberg is happy to remain in Berlin to connect her SFO music-life mission with the Berlin Philharmonic. Most Berliners consider it a great fit.\n\n*ANG column of November 4, 2005 under headline:**\"Parting Words from S.F. Opera Director Pamela Rosenberg\"***\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2001, when Pamela Rosenberg stood before journalists, critics and media people packing the expansive lobby of San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, she said she believed that opera had the potential to make people think and feel more deeply about the human condition.\n\n\"My goal as your new general director,\" she said, \"is to enable our audiences to see interconnections between life and art and to give them, through our 'Animating Opera' five-year program of themes, points of orientation to help them develop their own antennas.\"\n\nShe then clarified that the project would \"be more than just intellectual\" and promised that there would be \"a Verdi in every season.\"\n\nSummarizing, she said, \"I want to spark curiosity in the audience.\"\n\nNow, nearly five years later, she feels that this has happened.\n\nDuring an interview last week in her office in the upper reaches of the San Francisco Opera House, she told me, \"I think we've piqued the people's curiosity and convinced them to try new (operatic) experiences.\"\n\n*\n\nA sophisticated, warm, 5-foot, 11-inch tall woman with beautiful deep blue eyes and wheat-colored hair cut in a youthfully chic style, Rosenberg earnestly expressed the thought that there has been no downside to the adventurous programming of her San Francisco tenure.\n\n\"The unfamiliar and new works have sold no worse than the standards, and sometimes have done better,\" she said.\n\n**Ambitious Francois***\n\nA case in point was the ambitious 2002 North American stage premiere of Olivier Messiaen's rather oblique *St. Francois d'Assise*. Following its San Francisco run, the *New York Times* marveled, \"The run of six performances sold better than Puccini's *Turandot*, which was playing at the same time, with Jane Eaglen in the title role.\"\n\nThe report also noted that its last three performances were sold out, with lines of people standing outside the doors hoping for tickets.\n\nRosenberg stressed that she was equally happy about San Francisco's extravagantly praised production of Rossini's traditional *The Barber of Seville* as she was about the more abstract *St. Francis*.\n\n\"Our *Barber*, which even had Tom Hampson riding a motorcycle onstage, was sparkling and fun in an up-to-date way,\" she mused with a smile. \"I am happy with how wide-ranging our opera presentations were and feel really proud of the things we produced ourselves.\"\n\nShe felt that the inclusion of Ferruccio Busoni's *Doktor Faust* provided much needed insight into the Faust legend. Also, that Janacek's *The Cunning Little Vixen* and his *Kat'a Kabanova* as well as Shostakovich's *Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk* ' although collaborations with other companies ' were likewise important milestones.\n\nShe is enthusiastic about the current *La Forza del Destino* production, describing it as a \"long project that the company has really delved into.\n\n\"We've not done it historically,\" she said, \"but have sought to show it more universally and focus on how war affects almost every aspect of everyday life.\"\n\n**Lessons learned**\n\nIn answer to my question about what she has learned from her San Francisco Opera years, she grinned broadly and quipped, \"I learned NOT to do *The Mother of Us All* on opening night!\"\n\nAnother surprise was the negative audience reaction to the 2002 production of Handel's *Alcina*.\n\n\"I was not prepared for *Alcina* to be so controversial. A Stuttgart production, we had done it countless times in Germany. We took it to the Edinburgh Festival, where it was named production of the year, after which it was shown and praised on television all over Europe. I was simply shocked that it was so controversial here in San Francisco.\"\n\nShrugging her shoulders, she said that a man sent her an e-mail telling her about a dinner party he had attended with seven other people who had seen *Alcina*. Half of them hated it and half loved it. They discussed it for the entire evening.\n\n\"When is the last time you've been at a dinner party where you discussed an opera for the entire time?\" she asked. \"At least our production made them think.\"\n\nShe also admitted that she initially had fears about doing the huge *St. Francis* production in 2002.\n\n\"I was worried that doing *St. Francis* so early in the game might have be dangerous ' but it had the opposite effect. It turned out to be a fabulous way to begin. Although it was such a tremendous challenge for everyone in the company, the act of making it all happen together really bonded us all. We all ' the designers, the costumers, the set-builders, the chorus, the orchestra ' had a real sense of unity and togetherness from that point on,\" she said.\n\n\"I remember catching sight of the backstage manager walking across the stage with tears in her eyes after the curtain went down at the last performance. Concerned that something awful was wrong, I went over to her and asked if she was all right. She answered that she was fine, but was just sad that it was the last performance.\"\n\n**Off to Berlin**\n\nAs Rosenberg nears the end of her final San Francisco Opera season, she's getting ready to head to the Berlin Philharmonic to become the first woman, as well as the first American, to serve as that vaunted organization's administrative director.\n\nIt will not be a big change for Rosenberg, however.\n\nBetween 1971 and 2001, she worked in Germany where she earned high honors for her 10 years as co-general director of the Stuttgart Opera, after working as manager of artistic affairs at the Netherlands Opera, director of operations for the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, and with the Frankfurt Opera.\n\nBorn Pamela Henry in California in 1945, she has spent much of her life abroad. Since her father was a naval officer, the family lived in Puerto Rico, then in Venezuela. Pamela came back to the States to attend high school in Pennsylvania and in Beverly Hills before enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley. During this youthful period she had spent 10 years as a serious piano student.\n\n\"I almost had a nervous breakdown trying to decide whether to major in history or music at Berkeley, but eventually settled into European and English history. By the time I graduated, though, I knew that I wanted to be a stage director ' preferably an opera director. During those years, I spent a lot of time in the standing room sections of the San Francisco opera and symphony.\"\n\nAfter Berkeley, she went on to study with Wieland Wagner in Bayreuth, Germany, and then to the Guild Hall School of Music and Drama in London and the London Opera Centre, where she earned a diploma in stage management.\n\n**Russian history scholar**\n\nShe completed a master's degree in Russian history at Ohio State University (for which she wrote her thesis on the Mensheviki) before settling in to work as a teaching assistant and assistant producer and stage manager for Ludwig Zirner's opera program at the University of Illinois in Urbana.\n\nShe had a full life indeed in Illinois. She met and married composer-musicologist Wolf Rosenberg in 1968 (he died in 1996) and in 1970, their twin boys, Paolo and Sascha, were born. During that period, she and Wolf, who was a visiting composer/professor at University of Illinois, co-wrote a musical performance work called *Crockett*. It subsequently received a performance at Carnegie Hall.\n\nLooking forward to her Berlin appointment beginning in January, she explained that the present Berlin Philharmonic under British-born conductor Simon Rattle is a far different, more forward-looking organization than it was in the conservative von Karajan years. The famed orchestra now has 19 different nationalities represented in its ranks as well as a lot of women. The average age of its members is 37.\n\nThere are also strong family ties pulling her back to Germany.\n\nHer son Paolo, a film producer based in Frankfurt, is father to her two grandchildren, Nico, 11 and Leonie, 6. Paolo's fraternal twin, Sascha, works in Berlin is a television journalist with Deutsche Welle. Both are over 6 feet, 2 inches tall and movie-star handsome. (Both sons took off to be with their mom in San Francisco when she was awarded the prestigious San Francisco Opera Medal in a surprise ceremony on opening night for the 2005 season.)\n\nAt the close of our interview, Pamela repeated that she thinks San Franciscans have a uniquely high commitment to opera as a living art form.\n\n\"Other people in the world buy their tickets, attend and then go home,\" she stressed. \"In San Francisco, they are absolutely passionate about it.\n\n\"But,\" she added, \"I hope in future years, the period from 2001 to 2005 in San Francisco will be remembered as a time of great artistic enrichment and vibrancy.\"\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n#### Cheryl North Remembers Nathan Rubin**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - January 27, 2006*, under headline, Remembering Nathan Rubin - master violinist and populist**\n\n Nathan Rubin's musical colleagues will memorialize the dedicated - and versatile - violinist in a free concert Sunday afternoon in the Cal State University Theatre in Hayward.\n\n*\n\nWHAT IF one were to see the same person playing first chair violin with a respected classical symphony orchestra one night, only to spot him enthusiastically bowing an amplified violin in a rock band a few nights later?\n\"Not likely!\" most people would say.\n\nTheir tunes would change, however, after hearing tales about the late Nathan Rubin, (1929 -2005), who for more than 40 years was concertmaster for the Oakland Symphony, as well as its latter-day incarnation as the Oakland East Bay Symphony.\n\nBut ' and here's the kicker ' Rubin was sighted wielding his trusty bow on tour with Van Morrison and his band back in the 1970s. Yet he also could be found playing Bach, Mozart and Beethoven as well as works by such avant-garde composers as Luciano Berio, with numerous combinations of dedicated classical chamber musicians.\n\nHe performed with the San Francisco Symphony and Opera orchestras, the Joffrey and San Francisco ballet orchestras, the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra, the Skywalker Orchestra and the Golden Gate Theater Orchestra.\n\nAmong his many awards were a San Francisco Critics Award and a Hertz Award from the University of California. The city of Oakland declared April 8, 1993, \"Nathan Rubin Day.\"\n\nAt 3 p.m. Sunday, January 29, 2006, some of Rubin's closest colleagues and collaborators will gather to present a \"Nathan Rubin Memorial Concert\" in the University Theatre on the California State University East Bay campus.\n\nAmong the featured musicians are violinists Paul Brancato, Debbie Spangler, Debbie Dare, Kitty Jowe and Roy Oakley; cellists Lawrence Granger, Joseph Hebert and Dan Reiter; pianists Victor Romasevich, Ellen Wassermann and Eleanor Cohen; violist Joseph Gold; and harpist Janice Ortega.\n\nThe Oakland-born-and-bred Rubin began his remarkable career with a solo recital at Oakland's Chapel of the Chimes. The culminating piece on his debut program happened to be Paganini's Moto perpetuo* (Perpetual Motion), which indeed turned out to be a leitmotif for his entire life.\n\nHe attended Durant Elementary School, Hoover Junior High School and Oakland Technical High School. Neither his watchmaker father nor his mother was particularly musical.\n\nBut when Nathan was only 5, they gave him a quarter-size violin and took him for lessons with Theodore Anderson. Soon after, he began studying with Frederick Creitz, who guided the then 7-year-old Rubin to win a major violin competition in San Francisco. Eventually, Rubin was awarded a scholarship to study at Juilliard School of Music.\n\nDuring his productive lifetime, Rubin performed alongside Herbie Hancock, Aretha Franklin, Stacy Latisaw, Sly Stone, the Pointer Sisters, Patti LaBelle, Diana Ross, Jerry Garcia and a host of other popular musical stars. He has also been spotted sitting among the strings of a big-name pop orchestra playing dance music for San Francisco socialites as well as in concertmaster chairs for orchestras recording soundtracks for *Star Wars*, *Back to the Future*, *Soapdish* and *Predator 2*. He also served as conductor and violinist for the soundtrack of *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*.\n\nYet the remarkable Rubin was elegant and genteel in his bearing and demeanor. In fact, when I first met him, I thought that he could have been comfortably cast in a *Masterpiece Theatre* production as the elegant British butler in a 19th-century mansion.\n\nTeaching was another of his passions. He taught at Mills College and UC Berkeley for many years, and from 1974 until his death Oct. 13, 2005, he was a respected and beloved member of the California State University East Bay music faculty where he taught classes that ranged from classical violin to the evolution of rock 'n' roll.\nIn spite of what could seem like a total preoccupation with music, Rubin was a dedicated family man with two grown daughters from his first marriage and a very musical daughter with his second wife, Martha Henninger.\n\nOnce I asked Rubin about his unusually eclectic musical tastes. He answered, \"I guess it has to do with my dislike of musical elitism.\"\n\nI hope there are violins, as well as harps, in heaven.\n\n",

The Berliner Tagesspiegel* critic noted, \"It is after all something of an upside-down world when our fabulous\nBerliner Philharmonic Orchestra turns around on its orchestral stage\nto applaud ...\" while the Berliner *Morgenpost* critic extolled\n\"Finally another successful conducting debut with the Berlin\nPhilharmonic!\" The critique ended by praising Runnicles for\nsucceeding in \"giving form to the contemporary relevance of the\n(Britten) work\" and summarized with \"At the end tears were not wiped\naway, but a quiet joy over the achievement of the ensemble, and the\nPhilharmonic's lucky choice of Runnicles, nevertheless triumphed.\"\n\n**San Francisco is home**\n\nWe here in the Bay Area can hear and experience Runnicles'\ndynamic conducting several times a month during opera season and off\nand on during the year as piano accompanist for singers' recitals\nand chamber music concerts.\n\nRunnicles may be an Edinburgh-born Scot, but he has made his home\nin San Francisco. Before the Berlin engagement he said, \"I think\nthis is a wonderful place to live. ... I greatly love being at home,\njust pottering around. I don't like being peripatetic and flying\naround from branch to branch. I'm connected to the Earth.\"\n\nHis cozy office in the San Francisco Opera House is liberally\ndecorated with scenes of San Francisco and snapshots of his\ndaughters.\n\nHis voice warmed and his Scottish burr deepened when he spoke of\nhis South African-born wife, Elizabeth (whom he described as \"the\ngirl of my dreams\"), and their daughters, Ashley Isolde, turning 6\nthis month, and 8-year-old Tamara Sophie.\n\n**Named for productions**\n\n\"They are both little San Franciscans,\" he said. \"Ashley was born\nwhen I was in a 'Tristan und Isolde' production in Cologne. We knew\nthat the baby would have to be induced so I came across in time to\nbe here for her birth and then flew back to Cologne for the\n'Tristan' performances.\" Hence, the name Ashley Isolde.\n\n\"We found out about Tamara just after rehearsals for 'Der\nRosenkavalier' in Berlin back in '94, so we gave the name Sophie (the ingenue role in the opera) to Tamara.\"\n\nElizabeth Runnicles, too, has found fertile ground in San\nFrancisco. She's an accomplished violist and her husband describes\nher as \"being very active in chamber music in the area.\"\n\nWhen I first interviewed Runnicles 10 years ago, he revealed that\nhe met Elizabeth while he was conducting in Freiberg, Germany. \"She\nauditioned for the orchestra and made a great impression, not only\non me, but on the whole orchestra,\" he said. Shortly thereafter, she\nwas made a full-fledged member of the orchestra and she and\nRunnicles got engaged.\n\nSoon after that, the two moved to San Francisco and he began his\njob with the San Francisco Opera.\n\nWhen he looks back over the achievements of the last 10 years,\nRunnicles said he feels \"a little like a farmer who plants seeds in\nvery rich soil.\"\n\nA positive working environment, which includes good relationships\nwith San Francisco Opera's General Director, Pamela Rosenberg, is\none thing Runnicles finds so rewarding about being music director.\n\n\"I feel very supported -- we talk about everything and we plan\neverything together. I can only hope that we continue to be given\nthe chance, as we have been up until now, of introducing audiences\nto new works. There is a pioneering, ambassadorial side to my work,\nmy mandate, as the opera's music director. It brings with it an\nenormous responsibility with an enormous sense of fulfillment when\nwe can introduce people to new music and they think after\nexperiencing our 'Lady Macbeth' production, 'My goodness ...\nShostakovich! I must go out and buy his symphonies ...'\"\n\nThe Shostakovich \"Macbeth\" production came within a decimal point\nof outdoing \"The Magic Flute\" as the best-sold opera of this season.\nAnd the Messian \"St. Fran'ois d'Assise\" was the best-selling\nproduction last season.\n\n\"You just never know those things in advance. I suppose one of\nthe challenges of the next few years is that we don't necessarily\nneed to look to the traditional repertoire for cash cows. It may be\nthat more and more people want to be challenged with new things.\"\n\n\"Now I'm not putting a positive spin on these things,\" he\ncautioned. \"This is not spin; these are facts. And what does that\ntell us? That people feel they're being given as good as it gets.\"\n\n**'A real love affair'**\n\nTen years ago, his goal was to conduct more Wagner operas. Since\nthen he has been in the Bayreuth Festival and has conducted Ring\nCycles in Vienna almost yearly.\n\n\"I've had a real love affair with the Vienna Orchestra,\" he said,\npraising \"its stylistic idiosyncrasies, the burnished sound of the\nhorns, the sweetness of the woodwinds, the muscular strength of its\nstrings.\n\n\"All of this has an impact in terms of bringing that experience\nback to the San Francisco Opera Orchestra to work on its sound. It's\nextremely fulfilling working with the same orchestra over a decade.\"\n\n\"It's made more so in that I have a terrific partner in Pamela,\nwho wants me to be conducting as much as I can so that the bond\nbetween conductor and orchestra can only deepen. It then becomes\nless and less work, because we know one another so well.\"\n\nHe also noted that he loved doing \"Parsifal\" in San Francisco in\n2000 and having Nikolas Lehnhoff's mind \"probing into the piece.\"\n\nAlthough one of his focuses has always been Wagner, Runnicles\nemphasizes he enjoys many other works. \"I especially enjoyed conducting 'Pell'as et M'lisande.' Fell in love with it, and hope to do it again. I've always been very happy to cover as broad a repertoire as I can.\"\n\n\"For one to grow,\" he philosophized, \"it's necessary that\nnutrients be drawn from other things -- a cross-fertilization is\nneeded. My German opera conducting is all the better for the fact\nthat I've conducted Italian opera; my Italian opera is better for my\nhaving conducted French opera; and my French is better for having\nconducted Russian and Czech. Similarly, a fulfilled singer is very\noften a singer whose operatic experiences are informed by singing\nLieder.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, I have changed as a person. Being a father to two\nyoung girls informs everything I do, whether it's chatting with you,\nworking with my assistants or my orchestras, or when conducting an\nopera dealing with father/child content.\"\n\nHe recalled a recent conversation with the great Wagner\nbass-baritone James Morris following a production of Wagner's \"Die\nWalk're\" in Vienna during which Morris, in the role of Wotan, had\nchoked up in the final farewell duet with his daughter Br'nnhilde.\nIt was the first production Morris had sung since his wife, Susan\nQuittmeyer, gave birth to twins.\n\n**'Lived a wonderful life'**\n\nMorris explained to Runnicles that although he had sung that role\noften, having children helped deepen his understanding of the part.\n\"I've sung that role so often, and I know how to sing it,\" Morris\nexplained to Runnicles. \"But I swear, now, having those young\nchildren myself, and now imagining that it was Jennie that I was\ntaking leave of forever -- it just completely got to me and deepened\nmy performance.\"\n\n\"That's what we're talking about here,\" Runnicles summarized. \"I\nthink that within the past 10 years here, I've lived a wonderful\nlife. I continue to live a wonderful life. That can't help but\ninform and imbue my music making -- for better or worse, I might\nadd.\"\n\n'1999-2004 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Sarah Chang**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column from January 12, 2007*\n\nWhat sort of person would you expect to have such books as John McClaren's *Running Rings*, *The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich* and *The Guide to Finding the Perfect Handbag* on his or her current reading list?\n\n A fashionista? A historian specializing in the history of the Soviet Union? A person with a million frequent flier miles?\n\n What about a concert violinist?\n\n If you guessed the concert violinist, you would be right on target. Although it might seem incredibly unlikely, those are the exact three books that the beautiful, brilliant 26-year-old violinist Sarah Chang is reading — when she isn't spending four or five hours a day practicing her violin; or in a jet en route to some faraway Asian or European city; or on a concert stage happily performing for an audience of two or three thousand.\n\n This week, the lovely Ms. Chang performs Max Bruch's rhapsodic Violin Concerto with the San Francisco Symphony in Davies Symphony Hall with her good friend Kurt Masur, whom she calls \"one of my absolute favorite conductors,\" at the podium.\n\n Evidently Chang is someone who knows how to manage time very well indeed.\n\n Her 2006-2007 performing season includes such highlights as a European tour with the Pittsburgh Symphony under Hans Graf; a North American tour with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, also with Maestro Masur conducting; as well as appearances with American orchestras from Los Angeles, Houston, Milwaukee and New Jersey, in addition to San Francisco.\n\n The Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic are also on her play list, along with an extensive United States and European recital tour later in the spring, which will include a Cal Performances recital in Berkeley April 7.\n\n Why such a hectic pace? For one reason, she is thoroughly used to it. She already has 20 years of performance experience under her belt.\n\n Two of her first local solo concert appearances were when she was a bright-eyed child back in the mid-1980s with Barry Jekowsky conducting the California Symphony in Walnut Creek. The first of these featured young Sarah playing the daylights out of the daunting Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, and a couple of years later, Paganini's showpiece concerto.\n\n The second reason she endures such a demanding performance schedule is that she simply loves being on the concert stage.\n\n \"For me, the stage is my home,\" she said.\n\n She also says she loves the \"adrenaline rush\" she gets from having a live audience in front of her, as well as the \"old-school glamour\" of the classical music world with the male performers in tails, the women in beautiful dresses, and the soloist in a gorgeous evening gown.\n\n \"Every concert is magical,\" she says. \"The whole art form of being onstage is mysterious and fascinating.\"\n\n Earlier last month, Chang was chosen by *Newsweek* Magazine as one of the top eight achieving females in the country.\n\n In the article accompanying the announcement, Chang explained that after traveling to a different city every week for most of the year, the stage itself turns out to be the only really familiar place.\n\n During our telephone chat last week, Chang explained why she's chosen the Bruch Concerto, a piece many consider a weathered, sometimes saccharine, old chestnut to play in San Francisco.\n\n Although she agreed that the piece is almost universally popular, she stressed that \"There's a reason why it maintains such an important place in the repertory over the years. It's simply one of the world's very most beautiful, lyrical pieces. I auditioned with it for Juilliard when I was about 5-1/2 years old.\"\n\n One of her first Juilliard teachers was the great Dorothy DeLay, who also taught Itzhak Perlman. Delay has said that, in many ways, Sarah has always been an adult with regard to her intelligence and maturity.\n\n Another prominent musician who has extravagantly praised Chang was the late Yehudi Menuhin, who once called her \"the most wonderful, the most perfect, the most ideal violinist I have ever heard.\"\n\n Yet during our phone conversation, Chang's voice sounded typically girlish and full of youthful enthusiasm as she named shopping, horseback riding and gliding among her favorite non-musical activities.\n\n \"I also love to play tennis with my very athletic 19-year-old brother. He's a freshman at Princeton and the sweetest little kid,\" she says.\n\n![](/images/sarah-chang-informal.jpg)\n\n But when the conversation shifted back to music, her voice deepened and took on an immediate maturity.\n\n She said that the Brahms, Sibelius and Shostakovich violin concerti are her current favorites, explaining that, \"the Shostakovich, however, is not only one of the most profound, but one of the most punishingly monstrous pieces to play.\n\n While I played through it as a child, I deliberately waited until I was around 21 to tackle it again and just last year, recorded it with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic. It is a piece that explores every possible emotion.\"\n\n When I asked her what she would like to be doing 50 or 60 years from now, she hesitated a few seconds, and then replied, \"What I would really love, is to just continue what I'm doing now — not to be labeled as a 'prodigy,' but to be called a 'musicians' musician.' I want not only the audiences, but my colleagues, to enjoy my playing.\"\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Interview with Lemony Snicket,\n(a.k.a. Daniel Handler)\n**\n\n*Column for the ANG Newspapers run June 30, 2006 under headline*,** Snicket, Stookey responsible for symphonic murder**\n\nCould a funeral — or memorial service — be scheduled at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall? Or some other sort of mayhem? What's going on?\n\n \"The Composer Is Dead\" is the grim title of the program set for 2 p.m. July 8 in the San Francisco Symphony's laid-back \"Summer in the City\" series.\n\n When you see the name \"Lemony Snicket\" listed on the program as both the writer of the text and its narrator, the fog starts to clear.\n\n Since this seemed something that definitely merited investigation, I managed to have a phone chat with Snicket himself.\n\n*\n\n \"So what's so strange about the title?\" said the voice at the other end of the phone. \"Most composers are, after all, dead.\"\n\n It's true: Beethoven's been gone now for more than 150 years, Bach even longer, and composers as recent as Gershwin and Stravinsky have left the Earth for other domains.\n\n \"Nat, however, is still very much alive,\" Snicket hastily added, referring to Nathaniel Stookey, the composer responsible for the music scored to this latest of Snicket's writing forays.\n\n Snicket, of course, is the author of the whole series of children's books with eyebrow-raising titles like titles like A Series of Unfortunate Events*, *The Bad Beginning*, *The Reptile Room*, and *The Wide Window*, and so on. Even Snicket defines them as \"a terrible collection of books concerning the lives of the three likable but luckless Baudelaire siblings.\"\n\n Yet millions of children (and adults) worldwide have been snapping up these unfortunate books, thus turning Lemony into a dubious, but celebrated money-making machine. Even Hollywood jumped on the Snicket bandwagon, making last year's movie of *A Series of Unfortunate Events* starring Meryl Streep, Jim Carrey and Jude Law.\n\n Since no mother I can imagine — including one with the last name \"Snicket\" — would willingly saddle her child with the name \"Lemony,\" I asked the fellow on the phone if that was his real name.\n\n \"No. I'm Daniel Handler,\" he replied affably. \"Years and years ago, after my book *Basic 8*, (which was for adults) had been published under my own name, I began to get a lot of calls from various religious groups.\"\n\n He then explained that when one of these got a bit uppity and wanted him to verify his name, he replied with the first name that came to his mind: Lemony Snicket.\n\n There was this silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n \"Then the guy finally spoke up and asked if the name was spelled the way it sounded. I told him yes — and I knew that I now had a great pseudonym.\"\n\n Handler, it turns out, grew up right in San Francisco, where his mother was a dean at San Francisco City College. He attended Lowell High School and sang in the San Francisco Boy's Chorus before heading off for a degree at Wesleyan University, which he obtained in 1992. He is married, has a son, for whom he even got up for the 3 a.m. feedings and changed diapers. He also plays the accordion.\n\n \"I've played klezmer, tango, country, Irish, polkas and gypsy music and have been in a couple of bands,\" he said. \"Classical music has made me weep uncontrollably ever since I was a kid. I hope *The Composer Is Dead* does the same thing for a new generation.\"\n\n He then suggested I check with Stookey himself for a thorough description of the piece.\n\n*\n\n Stookey, a tall, blond, native San Franciscan who is married and also has a wife and son, has had a spate of successes with his music. He was a violinist and violist with the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra from 1986 to 1988 and has held a number of prestigious composer-in-residency programs, including with the Halle Orchestra in the U.K and the North Carolina Symphony.\n\n Stookey and Handler/Snicket knew each other while at Lowell High School, although not well. Stookey went on to spend 20-some years in France, England,and North Carolina, where he continued to hone his musical and compositional skills. During that period he was awarded a couple of prestigious composer-in-residency appointments, including the Halle Orchestra in the U.K. with Kent Nagano and the North Carolina Symphony with Gerhardt Zimmermann. After marrying, he and his wife decided to move back to San Francisco.\n\n \"It turns out that both Dan and I returned to the city about the same time and for similar reasons — to raise families,\" he said.\n\n He then explained that he and Dan met again quite by chance when Stookey, en route to pick up his son from school, saw Handler sitting at a sidewalk cafe. The friendship was renewed with gusto as the two found out how much they had in common.\n\n Later, while chatting with Edwin Outwater, the resident conductor for the San Francisco Symphony and former director of the San Francisco Youth Orchestra, Stookey casually mentioned Lemony.\n\n \"YOU know Lemony Snicket?\" Outwater responded — and immediately set out, with Stookey's help, to engage Snicket to serve as narrator for the symphony's Peter and the Wolf* performance last December.\n\n Soon, a commission to the two for *The Composer Is Dead* was solidified.\n\n \"So just what IS this tantalizingly titled piece?\" I inquired.\n\n Stookey explained that, like Benjamin Britten's *Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra*, it was primarily designed to teach children about the instruments and classical music. But whereas the Britten work is more or less a demonstration sort of piece, there's a definite plot line to the Stookey-Snicket piece.\n\n \"It's a murder mystery,\" said Stookey. \"The instruments are interrogated by section about why they wanted to (finish) off the composer. Even Outwater, the conductor, is a suspect.\"\n\n \"While it's all ostensibly for children, it's really directed to the larger group of thirtysomethings who are a bit alienated from classical music,\" Stookey said.\n\n He further described it as, unlike much contemporary music, \"quite accessible to first-time listeners. It's fun, despite being sometimes sinister and even downright scary at times.\"\n\nCheryl North's interview with [Nat Stookey](http://www.northworks.net/c_stookey.htm) from November 2004 is also on this website. [Lemony Snicket's website](http://www.lemonysnicket.com/author.cfm) has much additional information about him and his literary output.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\nCheryl North Interviews Patrick Stewart**\n\nJune 16, 1999. (Note: This version includes material cut for lack of space from the version printed in the ANG Newspapers.) *\n\nPicture the following scene: The setting is a place quite inhospitable to humanoid life forms. Jean-Luc Picard, lying on his stomach, is nose-to-nose with a non-human life form. Picard, of course, is outfitted with a portable oxygen supply and has protective see-through gear over his eyes, but this only piques the curiosity of the alien creature.\n\n*\n\nThe two stare deeply into each other's eyes, and wordlessly, without the even the need for a Vulcan mind meld, they share a poignant, deep communication.\n\nWell -- it wasn't really Picard, the fabled captain of the Starship Enterprise*, but it was Patrick Stewart, the fabled actor from West Yorkshire, England who created the role in the seven year run of TV's *Star Trek: The Next Generation* as well as in the series' three blockbuster motion picture spin-offs.\n\nNevertheless, the event described above by Stewart, actually happened. Instead of on a faraway planet, it took place on the bottom of an earthly ocean while Stewart was scuba diving.\nThe personable actor's piercing eyes became incandescent as he animatedly retold the tale during an interview Wednesday morning in his San Francisco hotel room.\n\n\"t was one of the great events of my life,\" he said, explaining that it happened when he and a few other colleagues from the Whale Conservation Institute were taken to a particular place where giant sea lions were known to gather.\n\n\"Sure enough, after a very short while, about nine of these wonderful creatures came to play. But this one seemed particularly curious about me, and nose-to-nose, we really communicated. He carefully investigated, but didn't harm, my diving equipment. My snorkel still has some of his teeth marks,\" Stewart said with a delighted chuckle.\n\nStewart, who has been lauded for his many accomplishments on television, in films, and on the stages of the world, is in town this week to perform as the Narrator, the Soldier, and the Devil in Igor Stravinsky's jazzy satire, *L'Histoire du Soldat,* (A Soldier's Tale) with the San Francisco Symphony. Performances will be at at 8 p.m. tonight, Saturday, and on June 23 at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco. Tickets range from $12 to $76. Call (415) 864-6000.\n\n\"I was very nervous during yesterday's rehearsal on stage (Davies Symphony Hall) with Michael Tilson Thomas and the Orchestra,\" he explained. \"This piece is especially tricky. It's usually done with a group of actors and dancers, but in this case I'm doing all the parts myself. Sometimes I have to recite the words in precise time with the music - and with Stravinsky's rhythms, it's not easy. But the whole thing is thrilling - a great adventure for me.\"\n\nWhile Stewart has received such honors as the prestigious *Will Award* from the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. at the hands of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a Grammy for his narrative work on the Best Spoken Word Album for Children, Prokofiev: *Peter and the Wolf*, and much, much more, he is most often identified with the Picard persona.\n\n\"It embarrasses me a little to say it, but I truly no longer know where I begin and he (Picard) leaves off. A lot of me has gone into this man, and there are some aspects of him that I've tried to absorb myself,\" he said.\n\nReflecting on the pervasive popularity of the Star Trek series, he continued, \"There is something larger than life about the series. *Star Trek*'s dialogue isn't ordinary dialogue . . . There is always this element of the parable sewn into every episode. The underlying themes and myths are often about 20th century society or larger philosophical or poetic themes.\"\n\n\"It seems to many Americans, that who sits in the Captain's chair on the Enterprise is more important than who occupies the throne of England,\" he quipped. \"It still is some wonder to me.\"\n\nHis own particular favorite among his many *Star Trek* episodes is one called \"In a Light,\" in which his own son, Daniel, played the role of his son in the story.\n\nWhile not particularly tall, Stewart, dressed in slim-fitting jeans and a casual blue checked open-collared shirt, appeared superbly fit and muscular. Even though he's approaching his 59th birthday and has only a faint rim of shaved hair visible on an otherwise bald head, there is something about his demeanor and bearing that causes him to be repeatedly cast as powerful men. Over the years he has played emperors, princes, prime ministers, and trade union leaders.\n\nIn modestly assessing his successes in portraying the great and the powerful, he said, \"I really try to make them as accessible as possible, and yet at the same time, allow them to properly hold on to the authority that is built in to their various positions,\" he said.\n\n\"I look for the contradictory elements of the man's personality. If he is very articulate, I look for just what it is that makes him speechless. If he is strong, I try to find what makes him vulnerable.\"\n\nAcknowledging Vice-President Al Gore's statement earlier that day, that the present world seems to suffer from a \"deficit of decency,\" Stewart philosophized that a good part of Picard's appeal might be because the captain maintains a sense of \"decency, even under the most difficult situations.\"\n\nThen, as a broad smile spread irrepressibly across his face, Stewart recalled, \"Yesterday, while coming up here from L.A., I chatted with a businessman on the same flight. He told me that most of the important things he'd learned about leadership, he learned from Captain Picard!\"\n\nIn spite of his mounting successes in the performing arts, Stewart considers himself a late-comer to the world of music.\n\n\"Back in 1963 I had a job in Liverpool, England,\" he reminisced. \"Everyday I crossed the Mersey River on a ferry and took a shortcut to the place where I worked, walking right past a place called 'The Cavern' - totally unaware of anything like the Beatles.\"\n\n\"As a child, I heard very little music, classical or otherwise. It just wasn't a part of my upbringing. The only part that it played in my early life was hearing my mother downstairs singing hymns along with a religious program on the radio on Sunday mornings. As a result, I'm probably one of the few people who know ALL the verses of hymns and Christmas carols. I know verses of 'Good King Wenceslas' that you've never heard before.\"\n\nHe came upon classical music even later, when dutifully accompanying his first wife, choreographer Sheila Falconer, to London performances of the English National and Opera North opera companies.\n\n\"I found that, eventually, it was not just a matter of doing my duty, but that I was actually enjoying the experience.\"\n\nHe encountered even more music while performing in the Royal Festival Hall's production of the play *Every Good Boy Deserves Favour* by Tom Stoppard and Andrei Previn, which involves a symphony orchestra. Stewart rather gleefully noted that he \"actually got to sit in the middle of the violin section in the orchestra.\"\n\nIt was not until his 1987 move from England to Los Angeles that classical music seriously took hold in his psyche. \"Since I was alone,\" he explained, \"I found that I was increasingly turning to the classical radio station KUSC for company and relaxation and I particularly enjoyed listening to the disc jockey's analyses of the music.\"\n\nThen, in 1992, he directed a production of the Stoppard/Previn play, in which he starred with four other cast members of *Star Trek* and the Orange County Symphony Orchestra. The next year, the show went on the road and involved the Chicago, Minneapolis and Atlanta symphonies.\n\nHe has even done some singing (he considers himself a \"light baritone\") and has performed in Hollywood Bowl productions of Sondheim's *Sweeney Todd,* and as King Arthur in Lerner and Lowe's *Camelot* along with Jennifer Larmore and Rodney Gilfrey.\n\nA dedicated polymath like Picard, Stewart's interests range far beyond his particular vocation. \"One of the pleasanter aspects of notoriety is that you can make a difference in the world,\" he said. \"Amnesty International is one of my deepest commitments. I believe in it because it fights against human rights abuses wherever they might occur in the world - in spite of politics. It occupies a lot of my free time.\"\n\nHis involvement in the Whale Conservation Institute stems from his longtime association with Dr. Roger Payne, the scholar/researcher responsible for the first recordings of whale song back in the 1960s. \"One of my closest women friends had the good sense to marry Roger and we've been friends and fellow divers ever since,\" he said.\n\nNext month he will travel to Tanglewood, Massachusetts where he will perform several works with the Boston Symphony, including Richard Strauss' *Enoch Arden*, for narrator and piano, with Emanuel Ax. And, he noted that one of his fondest hopes for the future is to promote and star in a revival *Assassin*, a work he considers Sondheim's best.\n\nMusic it seems, is destined to play an increasingly significant role in Stewart's life. Last month he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the shining citadel of the music world, the Juilliard School in New York.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Nat Stookey\n**\n\n*ANG Newspaper Column, November 19, 2004.*\n\nIf only Nathaniel (Nat) Stookey's great grandfather could have known, that the faithful old violin he used to play for barn dances, would one day play the great classics in the hands of his musically gifted great grandson.\n\n*\n\n\"I still use his violin once in a while,\" said the soft-spoken 33-year-old Stookey during a phone conversation earlier this week. \"But now, I'm really more interested in composing.\"\n\nIndeed, much of the classical music world has become interested in what Nat composes. The Oakland East Bay Symphony will open its 2004-2005 season with Nat's \"Big Bang\" tonight at 8 p.m. at the Paramount Theatre, 2025 Broadway, in Oakland. Michael Morgan will conduct.\n\nWhile the OEBS performance will represent Big Bang's West Coast premiere, Stookey originally wrote it to serve three purposes: it was one of many requirements for his Duke University PhD degree; it was to be the piece opening the North Carolina Symphony's 2001 season; and it was intended to celebrate the gala opening of the area's important Maymandi Hall.\n\nHe geared its style and format to show off the acoustics of the new hall, which he explained was designed by the same architects who did the recent retrofit of San Francisco's Davies Hall and of the Tanglewood concert hall outside of Boston.\n\n\"As a result,\" Stookey said, \"the piece has some novel sound effects. Since it was for a gala event, I thought of the fanfares once played by the valveless trumpets. And since that instrument can only play three pitches, the piece is features a lot of major triads (which translates to non-musicians as being quite easy on the ears). I wanted it to be fun.\"\n\nAnother of Stookey's pieces, Out of the Everywhere*, will be performed next May by the San Francisco Youth Orchestra in the final concert of its season, and yet another piece will be played by the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble in March.\n\nStookey was actually born and raised in San Francisco. He attended the San Francisco's French-American International School and one year at Lowell High School. His maternal grandmother and his mother were both raised in Oakland, where his maternal grandfather had a barber shop for many years.\n\nBesides his violin-playing great grandfather, his only other musical relative is Paul Stookey of \"Peter, Paul, and Mary\" fame, his father's first cousin.\n\nAs a four-year-old, Nat fell in love with the sound of the violin when he heard one being played on the radio. He begged his mother to buy him one and to allow him to have lessons. Wisely, she consented to let him play the violin, but only if he had some piano lessons FIRST (a good idea, because then a child easily learns to read both treble and bass clefs). So, little Nat began piano at four and then at five, the violin. He became good enough to play with the San Francisco Youth Orchestra from 1986 to 1988.\n\nWhile he certainly loved the violin, he did not enjoy solo performances. As a result, he started dabbling in composition and found that he liked that far more than the idea of pursuing a career as an instrumental soloist.\n\nHis first compositional success, *The Head of the Creek*, was performed at the Hidden Valley Institute of the Arts. A few months later, when he was only 17, he became the youngest composer ever commissioned for the San Francisco Symphony's \"New and Unusual Music Series.\"\n\nHe then attended UC Berkeley from which he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Music, and later, went to Duke University, where he eventually earned a PhD Degree in Music.\n\nBy the age of 23, he was awarded a residency with England's distinguished Halle Orchestra. While with Halle, he produced four compositions over three seasons. His pieces premiered at the BBC North, the Harrogate International Festival of Music, and at Manchester's Free Hall.\n\nGood luck visited him once again when his piece for orchestra and narrator, entitled *Colliding with Chris: The Rhythmical Tale of a Runaway Bike*, was selected as a London Times Critics' Choice. It was subsequently performed in North America.\n\nWhile he was in North Carolina he met and married his wife. During these years he worked as a house painter, supervised children in an after-school program, and waited tables at restaurants to make ends meet. Things changed, however, when he was awarded a three-year Composer-in-Residence grant with the North Carolina Symphony. The grant was funded by Meet the Composer, a New York City foundation that places composers in residencies with symphony orchestras throughout the United States.\n\n*Big Bang*, his first production during his NCO residency, was followed by additional compositions for the Mallarme Chanber Players, the Ciompi Quartet, and for the NC Symphony.\n\n\"Other than the fact that you draw a salary,\" he said, \"the best thing about a residency with an orchestra is that you develop a relationship with the orchestra and the conductor, who in the case of the NCO, was Gerhardt Zimmermann.\"\n\nAnother thing that grew out of his North Carolina years was a CD, *Music for Strings, 1992-2002*, produced by Albany Records.\n\nIn 2003, following the completion of his PhD and his NCO residency, the family, which now included two children -- son Milton and daughter Gertrude -- moved back to the Bay Area. His wife is a doctor and works as an epidemiologist at Stanford University.\n\n\"We wanted to raise our children out here and to be nearer to our parents. My parents and my wife's parents both live in the same San Francisco zip code,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about future projects, Stookey spoke enthusiastically about a new collaboration to work with Lemony Snicket to write an orchestral piece for children. ([See June 2006 interview with Lemony Snicket](http://www.northworks.net/c_snicket.htm).)\n\n\"The first classical piece remembered by most children is either Prokofiev's *Peter and the Wolf* or Benjamin Britten's *Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra*, Stookey said. We want to create something that will also bring children to classical music and have a positive impact on them.\"\n\nHe also said that he had a Chamber Opera on his mind for the future as well as some songs.\n\n\"My faraway goal is that I hope people will still be listening to my music many years from now. But my bottom line is that I LIKE writing music. I really get a charge out it!\"\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\n Cheryl North Interviews Bryn Terfel**\n\n This material appeared in a November 1997 column in ANG newspapers. An\n additional quote from a 2000 column is included.*\n\n by Cheryl North\n\n Bryn Terfel doesn't look like an opera star. Moreover, on a one-to-one basis,\n he doesn't ACT like one either. But, make no mistake, the husky Welsh\n bass-baritone, now in his mid-30's, is one of the operatic world's greatest\n treasures. He has just completed a stint singing the role of the diabolical\n Nick Shadow in the San Francisco Opera's recent production of \"The Rake's\n Progress,\" by Igor Stravinsky. Earlier this month, he performed a sold-out,\n\n![](/images/terfel.jpg)\n\n critically acclaimed solo recital with pianist Malcolm Martineau at Zellerbach\n Hall on the UC Berkeley campus.\n\n Although the 6 foot 3-inch singer is often awesome and larger than life on the\n operatic stage, he was unassuming and friendly one afternoon a couple of years\n ago as he personally led me down the narrow back-stage hall leading to his\n dressing room at the San Francisco Opera house for a hastily scheduled\n interview. Dressed in a casual golf shirt and slightly crumpled pants, he had\n a benign, hail-fellow-well-met presence and bonhomie that made me think of\n Smoky the Bear.\n\n But, as he spoke, images of the late Richard Burton, a fellow Welshman, came\n quickly to mind. Terfel, like Burton, seems to caress each word he speaks,\n burnishing the English language with a warm Welsh burr.\n\n His singing voice is one of the truly magnificent instruments of the 20th\n century with a massiveness that warms the soul like a blazing hearth fire on a\n snowy night. It is a keenly focused voice with huge proportions, yet it is\n flexible and has a texture one critic dubbed \"like cashmere.\" Moreover he has\n a way with phrasing similar to Frank Sinatra in his salad days and like\n Sinatra, he can imbue a song (or an aria) with an immediacy and intimacy that\n can reach out and grab an audience.\n\n Yet, Terfel the man is amazingly modest and unassuming in demeanor and\n deportment.\n \"I didn't really plan to be a singer,\" he said. \"I was interested in sports\n when I was young and played soccer and rugby. Had I not gotten into singing, I\n probably would have become a policeman or a fireman,\" he continued, as the\n corners of his eyes crinkled along with his smile.\n\n Terfel and his brother, now a physical education teacher, were born on a sheep\n and cattle farm in Pantglas, Wales, a small village in the country's rugged\n north. While sports were his greatest interest growing up, music did play an\n important role. Both his father and mother sang in church choirs and he easily\n followed in their footsteps.\n\n \"It was just part of village life,\" he says of singing in Wales. \"It was\n something that brought people together and we simply enjoyed yourselves.\"\n\n Terfel also took piano lessons, tried trumpet, clarinet, and guitar, and\n regularly sang in the local Welsh singing contests (eisteddfods). Whenever he\n won one of the monetary prizes in a contest (about $20), he would usually use\n the money to buy football boots or a bit of sports equipment.\n\n However, as his teenage years drew to a close, he was urged by a music teacher\n to head for London to audition for a music school. Although he had indeed sung\n a lot in his youth, opera was not part of his early training. Like most\n teenagers, his musical interests centered on pop and rock and his favorites\n were Elvis Presley, Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and Queen.\n\n \"If someone had asked me who Pavarotti was when I was 16, I couldn't have told\n them,\" he said.\n\n As a result of the teacher's prodding, for the first time in their lives, Bryn\n and his parents set out for London where he was to audition for the Guildhall\n School of Music and Drama. Going to London was \"like culture shock,\" he says.\n\n And - in London, it was vini, vidi, vinci. He came, he saw, and he conquered.\n He was not only accepted at Guildhall, he was awarded a scholarship. While\n there he studied voice with Arthur Reckless and Rudolf Piernay and haunted the\n school library where he listened to opera and song recordings and studied\n scores. In his last Guildhall year he entered a competition and walked away\n with the school's Gold Medal.\n\n Since then he has won the Kathleen Ferrier Competition, one of the most\n prestigious in Britain, as well as the Lieder (art song) prize in the highly\n visible \"Singer of the World\" competition in Cardiff, Wales in 1989. (Another\n young baritone, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, won the first prize that year).\n\n Terfel's subsequent ascent into the stratosphere of operatic superstardom has\n continued with rocket speed. He has appeared in Strauss\" \"Salome;\" Wagner's\n \"Das Rheingold;\" as Wolfram in Wagner's \"Tannhauser;\" Scarpia in Puccini's\n \"Tosca;\" Verdi's \"Falstaff;\" Offenbach's \"Les Contes d\"Hoffmann;\" Britten's\n \"Peter Grimes;\" has sung the roles of both Leporello and the Don in Mozart's\n \"Don Giovanni;\" and Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\" and in productions of\n \"The Marriage of Figaro\" with the Welsh National Opera; English National\n Opera; Santa Fe Opera; Royal Opera, Covent Garden; the Salzburg Festival; New\n York's Metropolitan Opera; Chatelet in Paris; Lisbon Opera; and at La Scala in\n Milan. And, to the opera world's great delight, he has finally contracted to\n sing his first \"Wotan\" in Wagner's \"Das Rheingold\" in Munich in 2001.\n\n His recordings of Schubert's \"Schwanengesang;\" \"An Die Musik: Lieder;\" \"The\n Vagabond;\" Rodgers and Hammerstein hits; Lerner and Lowe favorites, have\n earned kudos from audiences and critics alike.\n\n He has also worked with some of the world's greatest conductors, including the\n late great Sir Georg Solti, of whom he says, \"It was like working with a God.\n He was 84 at the time, but his energy and enthusiasm levels put everybody else\n to shame.\"\n\n \"As an opera singer, your path is pretty well sorted out and planned six years\n in advance,\" he says. \"Yet, I can't complain. I'm in a very fortunate position\n with my career now. I can more or less pick and choose whatever I want to do.\n I have a contract with Deutsche Grammophon and they are very flexible with my\n brainstorms. I hope to even record some Gilbert & Sullivan one day.\"\n\n Nevertheless, he maintains close links with his Welsh roots. He regularly\n sends postcards back to the Pantglas Post Office, which are, in turn, posted\n on a board for all the locals to share and he meets as often as possible with\n the mates he grew up and still considers among his closest friends. All this\n is helped along, no doubt, by his marriage to his childhood sweetheart,\n Lesley, and the subsequent birth of their son, Tomos, now three-years-old.\n (Tomos is the Welsh spelling for Thomas).\n\n \"We met in primary school,\" he says of Lesley. \"She's my best friend and\n critic. You've got to have somebody to tell you the truth about how you're\n doing, and she does!\" He also noted happily that Lesley and Tomos often\n traveled right along with him.\n\n Terfel remains keen on sports, but due to the constraints of his singing\n career, his former jousts on soccer or rugby fields have been replaced by\n milder forays at snooker and golf. Recent back surgery has also slowed his\n athletic activities a bit.\n\n Although he has enormous respect for fellow baritones like Dmitri\n Hvorostovsky, Thomas Hampson, and the like, he doesn't foresee any combining\n of forces for a baritone equivalent of \"The Three Tenors.\"\n\n \"We're all in the same lake, so to speak, but we're all in different boats,\"\n he says.\n\nHe also retains his eclectic taste in music and recounted rather gleefully his\n appearance on British television several Christmases ago with fellow Welshman\n Tom Jones.\n\n \"The show was called \"Tom Jones and Friends,\"\" he said, \"and included me, the\n American singer Toni Braxton and Mark Knofler of \"Dire Straits.\" Jones and I\n sang \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" as a duet.\"\n\n He also noted that, although an opera singer's life resembles that of\n supermodels and stars like Cindy Crawford, Pierce Brosnan, and the like, with\n stops along the same circuit - Milan, Paris, London, New York - the\n accompanying fame is not at the same level. \"It's the kind of stardom that\n allows us to go to the corner Safeway and be treated like everybody else,\" he\n said.\n\n As an example, he recounted the occasion during his last visit to San\n Francisco when he, Lesley, Tomos, and the nanny all dropped into San\n Francisco's Planet Hollywood. \"The food was great and I didn't seem to be\n recognized. Maybe someone thought I was Gerard Depardieu or something because\n of my nose - I wracked it up two or three times on the rugby field - but no\n one singled me out for special treatment. That was cool.\"\n\n From Cheryl North's June 2, 2000 Column in ANG Newspapers: Force of Nature\n\n The inimitable Bryn Terfel, whom Lotfi Mansouri agrees is \"a force of nature,\"\n will further display his remarkable versatility during a Cal Performances\n recital featuring songs by Hugo Wolf; Robert Schumann; Brahms (``Vier Ernste\n Gesange''); Butterworth; John Ireland; Hubert Parry; Roger Quilter; Michael\n Herad; Idris Lewis; as well as a number of traditional Welsh songs, at 8 p.m.\n Saturday in Zellerbach Hall on the University of California campus in\n Berkeley.\n\n © 1999-2002 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Classical Music:\n\n 2011 Interview with Swedish Soprano Iréne Theorin, Opening Night Turandot that year for the San Francisco Opera**\n\nColumn by Cheryl North, published September 2, 2011 by the Bay Area News Group under the headline, \"Swedish Soprano Theorin chills the blood, warms the voice for her turn in *Turandot*.\"\n\nWagner's Brünnhilde? Absolutely. Puccini's Turandot? A stretch of the imagination.\n\nThose were the first words that ran through my mind as warmly smiling, strikingly blond and statuesque Iréne Theorin strode into the San Francisco Opera press room last week for our interview. Theorin is making her San Francisco Opera debut in the title role of Giacomo Puccini's *Turandot*, beginning at 8 p.m. Friday at War Memorial as the company opens its new season.\n\nTurandot, the quintessential \"cold fish,\" or more politely, \"ice princess,\" of Puccini's fictional ancient China, has come to hate all men after learning that one of her ancestors was cruelly raped. She hates men so much that when various princes travel to China to woo her, she gives each three impossible riddles to solve. Failure leads to a chopped-off head.\n\nFinally, Calaf, an exceedingly handsome prince of Tartary with a voice that sails up to a series of high C's, arrives on the scene — and worse yet, answers all three of Turandot's riddles correctly. When he realizes her dismay at the prospect of marrying him, he tells her he willingly will go under the ax if she can find out his name by the next morning. To tell the ending would spoil the suspense, but be assured, it's worth waiting for.\n\nTheorin was one of six children raised in a forested Swedish village with a population she estimates at \"no more than 200.\" Everyone in her family played some sort of musical instrument. Her instrument was the trumpet. She also sang in the local church choir from an early age.\n\nHer formal musical studies were in Sweden and later, at the Royal Opera School in Copenhagen.\n\nSurprisingly, a recording of Alban Berg's jaggedly expressionistic, atonal opera *Wozzeck* caused her to think seriously about an operatic career. \"I seemed to fall into the big, heavy things right away — and I am a very hard worker,\" she mused.\n\nA scholarship enabled her to study in London, where she was befriended by the great dramatic Wagnerian soprano Birgit Nilsson. According to Theorin, Nilsson has been one of her primary musical inspirations — and indeed, the repertoire propelling Thorin to fame closely resembles Nilsson's when she was as the height of her career in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. This includes Brünnhilde in Wagner's *Ring,* Isolde in his *Tristan and Isolde,* Puccini's *Turandot* and *Tosca,* Richard Strauss' *Ariadne auf Naxos* and the title role in his *Elektra.* When she was still a student, Theorin sang Freya in Wagner's *Das Rheingold* and later made her professional debut as Donna Anna in Mozart's *Don Giovanni* in Copenhagen.\n\nDuring our chat, Theorin's comments and stories often were punctuated by her dramatic expressiveness and laughter. These came to the fore as she animatedly told of her remarkable experience singing Brünnhilde in a Stockholm performance of what is now called the \"Copenhagen\" production (a modern feminist interpretation) of Wagner's *Ring Cycle.* The saga is presented as a series of flashbacks in Brünnhilde's mind. The final scene has a very much alive Brünnhilde holding Siegfried's baby in her arms.\n\nTheorin's eyes widened as she gleefully confided, \"I was actually pregnant with my third son during the Stockholm performance. It worked perfectly with the director's concept that Brünnhilde becomes pregnant with Siegfried's child during the course of the cycle.\"\n\n\"The only problem was, I actually started feeling contractions and labor pains during the final strains of *Götterdämmerung.* My own baby was born only a few minutes later downstairs from the stage.\"\n\nWhile the role of Turandot is a polar opposite from Brünnhilde, Theorin still finds sympathy for the so-called ice princess. \"She doesn't really hate men, she is only afraid of them. She is playing a sort of power game with Calaf and, at the end of the opera, genuinely falls in love with him. The music, even though it is not kind to the voice, has an edgy aspect to it that really reflects Turandot's anguish.\n\n\"But,\" she added with a bit of mischief in her voice, \"do write that the Turandot character is not at all like me — I am only acting!\"\n\n*\n\nIréne Theorin as Brünnhilde on Brünnhilde's Rock, San Francisco Opera, 2018.

        "full_content": "\n### **Interview with Jean-Yves Thibaudet\n\n**\n\n*Column for the ANG Newspapers run October 20, 2006 under headline*,** For Thibaudet, music is played in the key of life**\n\nRemember that old saying, \"There are basically two kinds of people — those who describe a half-glass of water as half full, and those who describe the same glass as half empty?\" After a most amiable chat with the dashing piano wizard Jean-Yves Thibaudet in his Davies Hall dressing room last Monday, I propose there is yet another sort of person in this world, one for whom the figurative glass is neither half-full nor half-empty, but unabashedly brimming over.\n\n The youthful-looking Thibaudet, who resembles a leading man in a romantic French movie or the 19th-century heartthrob pianist Franz Liszt with a modern haircut, had just completed a rehearsal of the Saint-Saens Piano Concerto No. 2 with Semyon Bychkov in an adjacent room. After listening to a few minutes worth of lightning-fast virtuoso passages of piano music thundering from the room next door, I expected to be greeted by an exhausted, perhaps even panting, musician showing the wear and tear of a marathon runner after bursting across the finish line.\nBut no, the fellow bounding in, although he had beads of perspiration glistening on his brow, was energetic and even invigorated from his just-completed workout.\n\n*\n\n \"That sounded like hard work,\" I commented, nodding in the direction of the room from which the storm of piano passages had come.\n\n \"Yes,\" he said with an endearingly Gallic shrug, \"but I love it. Playing the piano for me is a most sensual experience.\"\n\n He explained, in a rapid, animated tempo, that when the audience is added to the experience, the circle of communication is complete. Music, he stressed, is about sharing one's self — and life itself — with other people, with one's audience.\n\n This, he said, was a reflection of the sage advice given him during a 15-minute conversation he had as a young prodigy with his idol, pianist Artur Rubenstein, during which Rubenstein extolled the importance of pleasing one's audience — before even the critics.\n\n Jean-Yves was born in 1961 in the French city of Lyon to a German-born mother and French father, both of whom, although musical, were academics. In addition to multiple diplomatic duties, his father taught history and geography at the University of Lyon and was a good amateur violinist.\n\n His mother taught German language and literature at the university, and was an accomplished pianist. She was Jean-Yves' first piano teacher.\nShe did her job well. At age 9, her young son played Ravel's dauntingly difficult and sophisticated \"Concerto in G\" with the local orchestra. At 12 he graduated with the gold medal from the Conservatory of Lyon. At 15 he won the premier Prix du Conservatoire.\n\n \"But this was when my father stepped in,\" Thibaudet explained. \"I remember him taking me to speak with the people at the Conservatory where he told them that he wanted me to have a well-rounded and happy life. He felt that, even if I were to pursue a career in piano, I should still continue with a full academic curriculum.\"\n\n His father died when Thibaubet was 19.\n\n \"But, I will always be grateful for his insistence about my receiving a broad education,\" he said. \"As a result, I have a great love for literature, languages, art, history, film, and a broad range of other things, in addition to music.\"\n\n His older sister speaks seven languages and works as an executive with the World Health Organization. But, he happily noted that he speaks four languages and could therefore read his favorite works — Dante's \"Inferno,\" Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry and Shakespeare's plays and poetry — in their original languages.\n\n \"But, the book which most deeply affected my life was The Little Prince* by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. Somehow, it captures the innocence, the wonder, and the openness of what life should be. I love how the Little Prince is able to discover so much about life within his love for the rose,\" Thibaudet said with shining eyes.\n\n With both his father and mother's blessings, he continued at the Paris Conservatoire where he studied with Lucille Descaves, who was a student of Faure and Ravel. Later he studied with Reine Gianoli, a student of the legendary Artur Schnabel, and finally, with Aldo Ciccolini.\n\n He won the top prizes in Italy's Viotti International and Busoni International piano competitions as well as the Robert Casadesus International Competition in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1980, he swept up the International Piano Competition in Japan and in 1981, the Young Concert Artists International Auditions in New York. His career soon escalated into full swing with concert tours and engagements throughout the world.\n\n I asked him about what some writers were beginning to call a \"Thibaudet sound.\"\n\n \"I'm not sure what they mean by that — unless it refers to my eclecticism,\" he said. \"I've loved jazz ever since I first heard it on the radio. Right from the beginning, it seemed to me to me to be just music — just as classical is.\n\n \"I've also had fun doing CDs with jazz master Bill Evans and I like playing Duke Ellington's compositions. I also love doing chamber music,\" adding that he has played and recorded with violinists Joshua Bell and Julia Fischer and cellists Truls Mork and Daniel Mueller-Schott, among others.\n\n Another favorite activity is accompanying world-renown opera singers, a task not usually enjoyed by major concert pianists. Perhaps it's from his love for opera that he has assimilated his remarkable ability in playing legato and making long melodic phrases seem to sing. He also acknowledged his love for films and film music.\n\n \"I was elated when the great director, Jane Campion, contacted me to play some Schubert pieces as background for her film *Portrait of a Lady*. She was brilliant,\" he exclaimed. \"And it was hard work — sometimes we did 50 takes to get the precise match of a particular segment of music to the onscreen action!\"\n\n Another Thibaudet thrill was working with Academy Award-nominated composer Dario Marianelli and director Joe Wright to perform the accompanying music for the latest movie version of Jane Austin's *Pride & Prejudice*.\n\n He seldom turns down a request to teach master classes and often involves himself in charity causes.\n\n So why do some Web sites about him rave that \"joie de vivre\" is what Jean-Yves is all about?\"\n\n Grinning broadly, he said, \"Every morning when I wake up I feel a sense of joy and optimism because I'm doing exactly what I love — and I get paid for it!\"\n\n![](/images/thibaudet-wandc.jpg)\n\nJean-Yves Thibaudet with Warner and Cheryl North backstage at Davies Hall, after the performance of the Saint-Saens Piano Concerto No. 2 by Jean-Yves Thibaudet and the San Francisco Symphony on October 18, 2006\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Two Interviews with Jean-Yves Thibaudet, 2006 and 2011\n\n**\n\n*Column for the Conta Costa Times and other papers of the Bay Area News Group, appearing January 21, 2011, under headline*, **Classical Music: Thibaubet gives a lift to legacy of Liszt in Berkeley recital**.\n**\n\nFor those of us who like our piano music strong and muscular but still packed with poetry and passion, there hardly could be a better choice than French virtuoso Jean-Yves Thibaudet's upcoming all-Liszt program at 8 p.m. Jan. 26 at Zellerbach Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley.\n\nYouthful-looking Thibaudet, 50, who resembles either a leading man in a romantic French movie or 19th-century heartthrob Liszt with a modern haircut, feels a strong affinity for the composer's music. Like Liszt, Thibaudet brings a dashing physical presence to his concert appearances.\n\nIn Europe at the time of this writing, Thibaudet communicated by e-mail about his upcoming recital.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to make a special tribute to Franz Liszt this year, the 200th anniversary of his birth,\" Thibaudet writes. \"Known in his time as the Paganini of the piano, Liszt took the level of technique at the piano to a new height, one that is still very hard to top.\"\n\nThibaudet also noted that Liszt likely would be quite at ease in our modern world. He was very flexible with the business side of music and was committed to championing his colleagues' music, often performing it in his own concerts. Liszt was also one of the most successful composers to write and perform piano transcriptions of symphonic or operatic works, including all the Beethoven symphonies and Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde*, a work Thibaudet will perform at his Zellerbach concert.\n\nAccording to Thibaudet, the only way most 19th-century folks could hear music by different composers was in a salon or a gathering at someone's home during which a pianist might perform a Liszt transcription of some great work. In addition to the Wagner transcription, Thibaudet also will perform Liszt's tribute to Chopin from his *Meine Freuden*.\n\n\"This piece, rather than being a transcription of a specific Chopin work, is more of a paraphrase,\" Thibaudet notes. \"It is a charming piece that I'm very fond of. Most people don't know of the existence of this piece. In this all-Liszt recital, I tried to find and program pieces that show the many different characters in Liszt's writing, which are amazing. He went through a lot of different periods of writing in his life. This particular piece will be like a little candy at the beginning of the second half of this recital.\"\n\nAmong other works on the program will be the gorgeous but technically daunting *Les jeux d'eaux a la Villa d'Este*, which Thibaudet said was a vivid inspiration for Debussy and the impressionist composers of the next generation. He also will play from his *Consolations*, his *Legendes*, the *Ballade No. 2* and the Tarantella from *Venezia e Napoli*, all of which are dazzlers.\n\nThibaudet considers Liszt an underrated composer. \"He is deep and serious. He changed the way music is written for the piano,\" he writes. \"I hope my recital will somehow show he is not only a fast showman -- he did have a talent like none other -- but that underneath he was a poetic and deep composer. If a Liszt renaissance is needed, I'm definitely part of this committee!\"\n\n*Column for the ANG Newspapers run October 20, 2006 under headline*,\n For Thibaudet, music is played in the key of life**.\n\nRemember that old saying, \"There are basically two kinds of people — those who describe a half-glass of water as half full, and those who describe the same glass as half empty?\" After a most amiable chat with the dashing piano wizard Jean-Yves Thibaudet in his Davies Hall dressing room last Monday, I propose there is yet another sort of person in this world, one for whom the figurative glass is neither half-full nor half-empty, but unabashedly brimming over.\n\n The youthful-looking Thibaudet, who resembles a leading man in a romantic French movie or the 19th-century heartthrob pianist Franz Liszt with a modern haircut, had just completed a rehearsal of the Saint-Saens Piano Concerto No. 2 with Semyon Bychkov in an adjacent room.

I love how the Little Prince is able to discover so much about life within his love for the rose,\" Thibaudet said with shining eyes.\n\n With both his father and mother's blessings, he continued at the Paris Conservatoire where he studied with Lucille Descaves, who was a student of Faure and Ravel.

        "full_content": "\n#### **Cheryl North Interviews Osmo Vanska, guest conductor for the San Francisco Symphony, October 22-31, 2009**\n\nMaterial from the Classical Music Column for the October 16, 2009 Preview Section, Bay Area News Group, under the headline, \"Osmo Vanska to bring music from his native Finland to Davies Hall.\"\n\nBy Cheryl North\n\nTHE BAY AREA is about to experience some bracing energy from the north when Finnish-born Osmo Vanska assumes the podium to pilot the San Francisco Symphony through two weeks of concerts from Oct. 22 to Oct. 31 at Davies Symphony Hall.\n\nVanska is navigating some high classical music seas these days. He already has traversed the orchestral works of fellow Finn Jean Sibelius with recordings of the complete set of the Sibelius symphonies with the Lahti Orchestra for the BIS (Swedish) label, as well as all of Denmark's Carl Nielsen symphonies with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, also for BIS. In addition, he has served at the helm of the Iceland Symphony, and since 2003, as music director of the acclaimed Minnesota Orchestra, with whom he has just completed performances and recordings of the complete Beethoven symphonies. Critics have lauded his interpretations of Prokofiev, Beethoven and other composers as \"blazing,\" \"bold\" \"audacious\" and \"risk-taking.\"\n\nIt's not surprising that his contract with Minnesota has been extended through the 2014-2015 season.\n\nI was struck by the deep resonance of his hearty speaking voice when he answered the phone from his offices at the Minnesota Orchestra headquarters for our scheduled interview. His enthusiasm, ready sense of humor and congeniality punctuated our chat with warmth and humor.\n\nHe loves the Minnesota landscape as well as his Minnesota Orchestra. One of his great joys lately has been switching from riding his Yamaha V Star motorcycle (\"It looks like a Harley,\" he said) to a pedal bike. \"I've ridden many, many miles through the beautiful countryside this past summer,\" he said. \"I love both the exercise and the beauty.\"\n\nOsmo Vanska was born in a small town called Saaminki on Feb. 28, 1953. His music-loving parents took their three sons (Osmo is the youngest) to concerts at least once a month and sent them to participate in the local music institute when Osmo was 9. One brother took up the trumpet, while Osmo and the other brother played violin.\n\n\"But then I heard the wonderful sound of the clarinet,\" he said. \"Then and there I thought how marvelous it would be if I could play that beautiful instrument in a symphony orchestra.\"\n\nSomething happened that changed him. When his parents purchased the family's first stereo when he was 12, he heard a recording of Leonard Bernstein leading the New York Philharmonic in Brahms' monumental *Symphony No. 2*.\n\n\"I decided that it would be even more marvelous if I were to have the whole orchestra as my 'instrument,' he said.\n\nHe proceeded to study conducting with Jorma Panula at the Sibelius Academy and, in 1982, won the Besancon Young Conductor's Competition. As it turns out, both great expectations of his youth have come about. He has played clarinet with the Turku Philharmonic, served as principal clarinet with the Helsinki Philharmonic and now wields his baton before orchestras the world over. However, I'm told that every now and again, he sits in with the clarinet section with his Minnesota colleagues.\n\nThe program for Vanska's Oct. 22, 23 and 24 concerts will include John Adams' *Slonimsky's Earbox*; Tchaikovsky's *Piano Concerto No. 1* with fellow Finn Antti Sirala as soloist, and Dvorak's *Symphony No. 7*.\n\nFortunately, as critics have singled out Vanska as one of the world's foremost interpreters of the enigmatic music of Sibelius, he will conduct that composer's incomparable *Violin Concerto*, with Russian Vadim Repin as soloist for the concerts scheduled from Oct. 28 through 31. Other works on the program will be Finnish composer Aulis Sallinen's *Symphony No. 1* and Beethoven's *Coriolan Overture* and his lighthearted *Symphony No. 8*. Sallinen's Symphony will not be performed at the shorter Oct. 30 6:30 program.\n\n![](/images/vanska-with-c-10-31-09.jpg)\n\nPhoto by Warner North, backstage at\nDavies Hall after San Francisco Symphony performance, October 31, 2009\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n### **Cheryl North Interviews\n Christopher Ventris**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column - June 30, 2000*\n\n Christopher Ventris has taken a few unconventional turns along his path\ntoward a major operatic career. The London-born tenor is currently in San Francisco for his U.S. debut singing the title role in the San Francisco\nOpera's current production of Richard Wagner's *Parsifal*.\n\nHis first major stage experience happened when he was 12 and sang the lead female role In Gilbert & Sullivan's *The Sorcerer* for his all-boys' school.\n\n\"Stage acting was much more fun than schoolwork,\" the genial singer said during a telephone interview last week. \"When my voice changed. I continued by participating in England's very good amateur operetta program. I was initially a member of the chorus, and we did 2 shows yearly. While I was there, I met Joy Mammen, a wonderful Australian voice teacher who had sung with both Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti. After studying with her for two years, she arranged for me to have an audition with the Royal Academy of Music.\"\n\nWhile at the Royal Academy, he earned extra money working as a clerk at the\nBritish retail chain Marks & Spencer and at a garage fitting tires. The Royal\nAcademy, however, proved to be a launch pad for bigger things, since major\ncoaches, teachers and performers from both the Royal Opera and the Glyndebourne\nFestival regularly worked with Academy students. Ventris was eventually given\nan apprenticeship with Glyndebourne and was assigned to be the understudy for\nthe role of Tom Rakewell in *The Rake's Progress*. A little later, he served as understudy for a production of Jan'cek's *Katya Kabanova* which, coincidentally, was directed by Nikolaus Lehnhoff, the director of San Francisco Opera's current *Parsifal* production. The young tenor made an important operatic debut in 1992 as Steuermann in the Leipzig Opera production of Wagner's *Der Fliegende Hollander*, which was followed by an appearance there as Narraboth in Strauss' *Salome*. The role of Kudryash in *Katya Kabanova* was the vehicle for his Covent\nGarden debut in 1994.\n\n*\n\nA major bit of serendipity occurred in 1998 when he\nreceived a telephone call asking if he would be willing to substitute for an\nailing tenor and sing the role of Max in Der Freisch'tz* at La Scala the very next day. After taking a few seconds to recover from the surprise, he said yes and prepared to board the next plane from London to Milan (he had sung the\nrole in Cologne only two weeks before). According to Ventris, the La Scala\nperformance went very well, even though he had only a single afternoon's\nrehearsal. His name became familiar throughout the Continent, since the\nperformance was broadcast live all over Europe. \"And, you'll never guess who\nthe conductor was,\" Ventris said. \"Donald Runnicles! We talked, and in August,\nLotfi Mansouri auditioned me in London for the role of Parsifal - and here I\nam.\"\n\nNow in his late-30s, the 6-foot 1-inch blond tenor pondered his future\na bit. \"Despite what my resum' says. I have not sung the role of Tamino in\nMozart's Magic Flute. Although Mozart is usually the route tenors take towards\nthe lighter Wagnerian roles, I personally find singing Mozart very difficult,\"\nhe said. \"Mozart requires a certain care and delicacy. One is expected to stand\nand sing beautifully in a Mozart role. But I feel more comfortable singing a\nbroader, vocally more physical line. With Wagner. I can be doing something like\nfalling to the floor or clutching at my head while I sing!\" This led to an\ninevitable question. \"When will you take on Siegfried in the Ring?\" I asked.\n\"Not for quite a while,\" he answered. \"Siegfried is one of the most difficult\nof all the written roles in opera. One is on stage singing for nearly five\nhours. I'd like to do Lohengrin and the role of Siegmund first,\" and after a\nmoment's hesitation, he added, \"Wagner, you know, is the graveyard of so many\ntenors.\"\n\nHere is a link to the\n[ Christopher\nVentris](http://www.christopherventris.com/menu.html) website, which includes this interview.\n\n[.](http://www.todddunning.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/)\n[.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/)\n[.](http://www.briandunning.com/)\n",

Neither his father, his mother, nor his sister were musical. But, since his father worked at the Sony Record Company in the city, he occasionally brought home records. Classical music played no particular part in the family's life, so the classical records were boxed up and put away.\n\nBut when Rolando was about eight years old, he decided to open some of the now dusty boxes and check out their contents. The first of the records he played happened to be Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.\n\nHe was stunned. He still remembers the exact \"Eureka\" moment.\n\n\"I had never heard anything so wonderful in my entire life,\" he said during an interview at the San Francisco Opera house last week.\n\n\"It was a new world for me. I was just blown away!\"\n\nHe didn't discover opera until about four years later when he bought the recording \"Perhaps Love,\" featuring John Denver and Placido Domingo. He nearly wore out the record memorizing all the words and singing along. Thoroughly smitten with Domingo's voice, he then bought as many of great Mexican tenor's records as he afford. Domingo became his idol.\n\nWhen he was about 17 years old, Rolando was asked to sing in a program put on at the La Salle High School in Mexico City. He chose \"Impossible Dream,\" \"Yesterday,\" and \"Granada,\" and tried to imitate Domingo's voice.\n\nRight after the program, Arturo Nieto, a prominent baritone, rushed up to meet Rolando. He became Rolando's teacher and his musical journey was launched.\n\nBut music didn't consume ALL of Rolando's passion. There was also the beautiful Lucia.\n\n\"Lucia means light,\" Rolando explained. \"And Lucia has truly been the light of my life.\" The two have been in love since he was 16 and she was 15. She was his only girl friend and is now his wife and the mother of their two sons, Dario, 21 months old, and Mateo, four months old. Although they make their home in Paris, they all with him -- at least until the children are in school.\n\nClearly lapsing into one of his favorite subjects, Villazon, continued his Lucia story, his black eyes sparkling and his hands gesturing expansively. \"I wouldn't be an opera singer if it were not for her. When we were in my car, driving to the place where we were going to get married, I told her that I had been thinking about becoming a history professor. I liked teaching, and thought that such a life would be more secure and quiet for us,\" he said.\n\nWith stage worthy gestures and drama, he continued. \"Lucia suddenly told me to stop the car! She said she had agreed to marry an opera singer. If I changed to be something else, the marriage was off. She told me that I had made her fall in love, not only with me, but with my dream as well. She said that she was willing to do whatever she could to help 'our' dream come true. So, we got married.\"\n\n*\n\nFor the next few years, Lucia, a psychologist, worked hard, sometimes from 6 am. to 10 p.m., while Rolando studied and practiced. As they agreed, how that his career is launched, he supports her.\n\nIn 1998, Rolando was accepted into San Francisco Opera's Merola program, during which he sang Alfredo in the Merola's La Traviata* at Villa Montalvo. After Merola, he moved on to the Pittsburgh Opera's training program.\n\nThrough all these years, Placido Domingo had remained his idol. He had long ago told the director of the Mexico City Opera that he hoped to one day meet Domingo. While he was in Pittsburgh, he received a call from the director with the news that Domingo was making a weekend trip to sing there the next Sunday. Would Rolando be able to come? According to the director, there was no guarantee that Domingo would have time to hear him sing, but perhaps Rolando could at least meet him.\n\nWith nary a second thought, Rolando replied, \"I will come. Whether I sing for him or not, I will come.\"\n\nAfter the big concert, the Mexican director motioned for the nervous Rolando and Lucia to follow him to Domingo's dressing room. When they arrived and were introduced, the gallant Domingo took Lucia's hand, kissed it, and then motioned for Rolando to sing.\n\nIt was another Eureka! moment. \"In that instant, my dream life met my real life!\" Rolando said, his face breaking into a radiant smile.\n\nSince that time, Domingo has remained one of the Villazon's most important mentors. Back in 1999, when he was pacing his dressing room floor just eight minutes before he was to go onstage for his professional operatic debut at the Genoa Opera House, his phone rang.\n\n\"It was Domingo,\" Villazon announced with appropriate drama! \"He said he realized I was about to go onstage, but that he just wanted to wish me all the best and to let me know he was thinking about me.\"\n\nA bottle of champagne from Domingo was in Rolando's dressing room prior to both his Met and Covent Garden debuts.\n\nVillazon and Domingo seem to share a number of commonalities. While Villazon is not as tall as Domingo, both share darkly handsome, \"heroic\" good looks, and Villazon, like the young Domingo, is slim and athletic-looking. Both their voices have strong, penetrating baritone timbres and tenor ranges, and each seems to have the uncanny ability to become consumed with whatever role he is playing at the moment.\n\nBut Villazon shares another formidable talent, not with Domingo, but Enrico Caruso, the great tenor of the early 20th century. Like Caruso, Villazon is a splendid caricaturist and draughtsman. He spends the day before the opening of each opera drawing witty cartoons characterizing the pre-opera rehearsals. He then gives copies as gifts to each of the cast members during the post performance party. You can see some of his drawings on his excellent website at [www.rolandovillazon.com](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/).\n\nWhen I asked him which operatic role was his favorite, he replied, \"Like Domingo, I am completely in love with whichever one I am currently singing.\"\n\nAlthough Villazon has already sung more than 80 performances of Verdi's \"Traviata\" in 15 previous productions at such world-class venues throughout the world, he will sing his first professional San Francisco \"La Traviata\" at 8 p.m. Tuesday at the War Memorial Opera House. Subsequent performances will be at 8 p.m. Sept. 18, 24 and Oct. 8; 7:30 p.m. Sept. 21, 27, 30, and Oct. 5; and 2 p.m. Oct. 3. His co-stars will be Ruth Ann Swenson and Mary Dunleavy alternating in the role of Violetta; Dmitri Hvorovstovsky and Zeljko Lucic in the role of Germont; Catherine Cook; Katherine Rohrer; Thomas Glenn; Ricardo Herrera; Joshua Bloom; and Stephen Bryant. Patrick Summers and Robert Wood will share conducting duties, while John Copley serves as stage director.\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)",

        "full_content": "\n### Interview with Deborah Voight\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - September 1, 2006,* under headline, **\"Voight's success not thinly veiled\"**\n\n*\n\nIn demand: Deborah Voigt stars as Amelia in San Francisco Opera's \"A Masked Ball,\" which opens the 2006-07 season.\n\nIt just doesn't seem fair. The greatest dramatic soprano of our age is dogged by fickle fashion.\nFirst it was the tempest-in-a-teapot brouhaha over not fitting into the little black dress designed for the Covent Garden production of the Richard Strauss opera Ariadne auf Naxos* a couple of years ago.\n\nNow it's the dilemma of the seven veils she will ' or won't ' wear in Strauss' *Salome.*\n\n\"It's a no-win situation,\" said Deborah Voigt, the newly slender soprano siren with the lush blond hair and sea-blue eyes, about her portrayal of Salome scheduled next month with the Chicago Lyric Opera. \"If I don't drop all the veils, people will think I'm trying to hide something. If I do, they could consider it gratuitous showing-off.\"\n\n\"One thing for sure,\" said the savvy soprano during a telephone conversation last week, \"my parents are a bit worried after seeing the provocative publicity picture put out by the Chicago\ncompany. Actually I haven't yet decided whether I will — or won't.\"\n\n Stay tuned.\n\n*\n\n At any rate, Voigt won't have to face up to the aforementioned dilemma next Friday when she sings the role of Amelia in Verdi's A Masked Ball* for the gala opening of the San Francisco Opera's 2006-07 season.\n\n Voigt is loved as one of the most down-to-earth, accessible superstars appearing on opera and concert stages today. Beyond the obvious allure of her megawatt voice, she has the ability to imbue each of the characters she sings with a sense of authenticity and intensity. Also, she's an excellent musician and plays the piano well enough to accompany herself if need be.\n\n Born in Des Plaines, Ill., Deborah is the oldest of three children. Her father was a businessman and her mother sang a great deal in the local church. \"Actually, I got my feet wet singing in church choirs too,\" she said. \"In addition, I played the organ and piano in church and even taught a children's choir.\"\n\n Her first operatic experience was when her grandmother took her to a performance of Prokofiev's *The Love for Three Oranges* in San Diego. She wasn't impressed.\n\"It wasn't a young person's best introduction to grand opera,\" she said, referring to the work's musical and textual complexity.\n\n Although she remains unequaled in her repertoire of demanding operas by Wagner and Strauss, she can also turn in stunningly sensitive, lyrical portrayals of Verdi and Puccini heroines. Recently, she played the title role in Ponchielli's *La Gioconda*, and of course, there's the upcoming Strauss' *Salome*.\n\n Her most recent recording, *All My Heart*, is a CD of American songs with pianist Brian Zeger for the EMI label. Her first solo CD, 2004's *Obsessions*, including arias and scenes from operas by Wagner and Strauss, was one of Billboard's top five bestsellers of the year.\n\n But like most of us, life has not dealt her an unabashed bowl of cherries. \"I'm a food addict,\" she said. \"After my parents divorced at the end of my high school years, my weight ballooned up. I tried every possible diet and workout regime with no luck and even had one of those gastric bubbles implanted in my stomach about 20 years ago when I was touring with Western Opera Theater. Even that didn't work.\n\n \"Finally, when my knees began giving me trouble and it was beginning to seem like that my quality of life was deteriorating because of my weight, I had gastric\nsurgery. It seemed the best thing to do, since now, other than needing vitamin B-12 shots occasionally, I have no health issues.\" In addition to watching her diet, she also lifts weights and does cardiovascular exercises.\n\n I asked if she thought her voice had been affected by the weight loss.\n\n \"Sometimes I have to stop and think a bit about my technique now, and sometimes I need to alter it somewhat, since I no longer have the heft behind it — but no, I don't think my voice has been affected.\"\n\n She noted that because of the demands of her career and extensive travels (she travels to a different locale every six weeks or so) she does not have much of a social life.\n\n \"In fact, single opera singers find it quite hard to get a date these days,\" she quipped. \"But, I have a great companion in Steinway, my little four-pound Yorkshire terrier. He travels with me everywhere.\"\n\n Voigt said she wants to be remembered as someone who always did the best she could: \"And, I also want to make sure that I didn't miss any opportunities along the way. I know I would regret it forever if I didn't get to sing *Salome* onstage — veils or no veils.\"\n\n \"With every exhortation against looking the audience's gaze is directed toward [ Salome](http://io.uwinnipeg.ca/~morton/modern_drama/12.pdf#search=%22%22christoph%20greger%22%20salome%22).\"\n[Christopher K. Greger, Ph.D.,](http://www.ccsf.edu/info/faculty_in_review/english.html) has writtten a probing study with new insights on the aesthetic conflicts and moral consequences of looking at Oscar Wilde's femme fatale -- an irresistible attraction for Richard Strauss' musical genius.\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n***\n\nCheryl North Interviews Arcadi Volodos**\n\nANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - February 4, 2003.*\n\nDuring a radio broadcast in 1939, Sir Winston Churchill said 'Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' These same words seem uncannily appropriate for describing Arcadi Volodos, one of Russia's contemporary sons.\n\nBorn in 1972 in St. Petersburg, Volodos has hit the classical music world like a meteor. He is a pianist in the grand, 19th century tradition. Many critics, including myself, feel that he now stands alone on that lofty pinnacle of pianism vacated by such late piano titans as Franz Liszt, Sviatoslav Richter, and Vladimir Horowitz. Volodos alone among the young crop of superstar pianists seems to embody the all-too-rare\n\n![](/images/volodos.jpg)\n\ncombination of virtuosic keyboard athleticism with profound musical intelligence and lyric sensibility.\n\nBut, after a brief conversation with him following his solo recital at Davies Symphony Hall last Sunday, Churchill's words about Russia resonated in my mind.\n\nVolodos is short, but stocky, and his head is crowned with a luxuriant mass of dark hair. Heavy black eyebrows frame his large expressive eyes. Although he appears downright heroic when at the piano, in person after the concert, he seemed shy, even a little ill-at-ease, with the mass of admirers waiting to greet him. He smiled courteously and spoke bits of English, a little French, and a lot of Spanish and Russian to his many local well-wishers, many of whom were local Russian expatriates. He also posed patiently, albeit a little stiffly, for the shutter-bugs among them.\n\nInterestingly, Volodos has never won, or even participated, in any of the famous piano competitions listed by many of the pianists of his generation.\n\n'I was just lucky that a Sony manager was present when I played at a friend's house in the south of France,' he said. 'This manager offered me an exclusive contract and we recorded a CD.'\n\nIt was this very first CD that won the prestigious 'German Record Prize,' thus launching his meteoric concert career.\n\nMoreover, Volodos never even came close to being a 'prodigy.' Unlike Lang Lang, Van Cliburn, Helen Huang or Adam Neiman, (all of whom hit the concert circuits in their pre-teen years), he did not even BEGIN serious piano study until the shockingly late age of 16!\n\nAnd, here's a clincher: 'I have never practiced scales and always got bad marks for technique' he says.\n\nSo where did he get all those silvery scale passages, lightning arpeggios and thundering octaves that he releases with such ease during his performances?\n\nWhen asked that question by a music critic/writer from the German Suddeutsche Zeitung, he answered, 'It is the LISTENING, not the PLAYING. I develop a sound image my mind and then I try to project this image in my music. That's all. It's not always easy, but for me it is the only possible way.'\n\nHe does not regard himself a virtuoso because of his razzle-dazzle, Olympian technique. Modestly, he says, that for him, such piano feats 'are not really difficult.'\n\n'Many people think only because there are really a lot of notes that the pieces have to be difficult. That is basically NOT the case. The big difficulties are in the musical form - it is really about achieving the correct sound image. Once you have this, you just have to play it back.'\n\nCritics worldwide seem to agree with his skills in this regard. 'Volodos seems to have a gift for preserving the intrinsic character of each individual piece and its musical values, while exploiting it for maximum visceral impact. It's all a great show, but it's truly musical in every bar,' raved Stereo Review.\n\nDuring Sunday's local concert, he deftly performed three Scriabin miniatures, followed by a group of seldom-performed Rachmaninoff Preludes and novelties that culminated in his own bravura piano arrangement of Rachmaninoff's orchestral 'Polka italienne.' Post-intermission works were a delicate Schubert Sonata in A-flat major; Liszt's 'Sonnet No. 123 of Petrarch,' as well as his 'Consolation No. 6' and 'Il penseroso.' Saint-Saens' 'Danse macabre' as transcribed by Liszt, with possibly a bit of improvisation by Volodos himself, completed the breathtaking program.\n\nDuring his early childhood in St. Petersburg, he was exposed to a good deal of classical music, since both his parents were singers. They started him off studying voice and conducting, along with the usual grammar school subjects. During his youth, he actually did conduct the M.I. Glinka Choir and the St. Petersburg Conservatory Orchestra for a few performances.\n\nIt was not until 1987 that he started serious piano training. His progress was so remarkable, that he was sent from the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music on to the Moscow Conservatory of Music where he studied with Galina Egiazarova. Then he went on to Paris where he studied with Jacques Rouvier, and finally to Madrid where he came under the tutelage of Dmitri Bashkirov at the Escuela Superior de Musica Reina Sofia.\n\nSince making his New York debut in 1996, he has appeared as soloist with the greatest orchestras and conductors in the world.\n\nCan one do all this in such a short time and still have some sort of 'other' life?\n\nAccording to his agent Steven Gates, Volodos loves tinkering with computers, cameras, fancy digital phones - 'just about any technological or electronic that he can find.'\n\nBut his primary life activity is indeed piano playing, affirmed Gates.\n\n'Arcadi always tries to arrange for a piano to be set up in whatever hotel room he stays in. And, he keeps at the piano off and on for most of the day. Music always seems to be on his mind.'\n\n'1999-2002 by MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers\n\n",

        "full_content": "\n**\n### Cheryl North Interviews Tappan Wilder on *Our Town* as an Opera**\n\n*ANG Newspapers Classical Music\n Column - August 10, 2007. (Note: this colum was abridged as published. This is the unabridged version submitted for publication.)*\n\n The first and only time I've seen Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1938 play, *Our Town*, was when it was performed by members of the senior class of Coachella Valley Union High School near Indio, California, when I was a freshman. The play's impact on my psyche was, and has ever after remained, indelible.\n\n That was why I, and countless others in the Bay Area are elated to hear that the transcendental *Our Town*, set to music by the famed American composer Ned Rorem, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, will be given its West Coast premiere tomorrow (Saturday) by Festival Opera at the Lesher Center for the Arts, 1601 Civic Drive, in Walnut Creek. Repeat performances will be at 8 p.m. August 14 and 17 and at 2 p.m. August 19.\n\n At first thought, such a monumentally great play ought to be easy to make into a great opera. After all, much of the required work - the shaping of a meaningful theme into a profound yet artful format - would already have been done by the play's writer, yes?\n\n Well --- sort of. Music can be dangerous. It has a pervasive emotional power as well as an almost mystical ability to insinuate subtle, even subconscious, meanings and colors to mere words. Like fire, music can illuminate or warm the word; or, like water, it can quell any of a word's potential fire.\n\n That's probably why, when composers Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland approached Thornton Wilder about making *Our Town* into an opera, he turned them down flat.\n\n According to *Our Town* librettist J. D. McClatchy, who is also a professor of literature at Yale University, \"Wilder's reasoning seems to have been that his plays were conceived in a specific genre, and to adapt them into another, would compromise their integrity.\"\n\n But that didn't stop Tappan Wilder, Thornton Wilder's nephew and the designated executor and manager of his intellectual property, from giving permission to McClatchy to set about the task of transforming the work into an opera.\n\n \"My uncle, who died in 1975,\" avowed young Wilder, \"left NO instructions saying 'never, ever' to set it to music. In fact, he broke his own rule himself,\" he said during a telephone chat from New York City last week where he and his wife, Robin, were taking a mini-vacation.\n\n \"After all, he allowed Copland to write music for a 1940's *Our Town* movie starring William Holden and Martha Scott, and later, permitted Bernstein to use some of his words in the *Chichester Psalms* and his *Mass*. Besides, he also wrote librettos himself for musical settings of two of his own plays, *The Long Christmas Dinner*. with music by Paul Hindemith, and *The Alcestiad*, with music by Louise Talma,\" the younger Wilder added.\n\n In program notes, McClatchy has written that, in 2001, there was a great deal of pressure on Tappan to approve a Broadway musical version of *Our Town*.\n \"But, Tappan could see that opera was indeed an appropriate medium to preserve the play's dramatic intimacy and emotional force, and thereby extend the its reach across time,\" he writes.\n\n It was also McClatchy, with Tappan's consent, who convinced Ned Rorem to undertake the music. Rorem, both Wilder and McClatchy agreed, seemed a natural fit to do so because of his passion for classic American texts and his mastery of vocal writing.\n\n The opera's East Coast premiere was in Feb., 2006 by the Indiana University Opera Theater. The initial reviews were full of praise.\n\n *The New York Times* concluded, that after beginning the opera with a hymn, Rorem \"retained and refracted the familiar melody, turning pat modulations slightly bitter, as if the music were heard through a lens of nostalgia that turned it sepia.\"\n\n *The Financial Times* critic wrote, \"Languorous melodic lines or fragments, many with an unmistakable American flavor, interact in the orchestra and the vocal parts engagingly follow suit.\"\n\n Sounds hopeful. However, some of the words and themes to which Rorem's music must measure up are formidable indeed.\n\n Wilder himself, in a \"Preface to Our Town\" published in the Feb. 13, 1938 *New York Times*, wrote that the play's central theme explores \"What is the relation between the countless 'unimportant' details of our daily life, on the one hand, and the great perspectives of time, social history, and current religious ideas, on the other?\"\n\n And, during our recent phone conversation, Tappan Wilder recalled, \"My uncle once told me that, 'since my play is about everybody, then everybody is in my play.'\"\n\n Tappan also stressed that *Our Town* has a dark side as well as a great deal of gentle nostalgia.\n\n \"It's actually rather existential,\" he said. \"My uncle was quite taken with the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre. Even though the play was a sort of complete immersion into everything about a New Hampshire village, he hoped that the audience would gradually feel it to be an allegorical representation of all life.\"\n\n Another sage friend of Tappan Wilder has said that *Our Town* reflects the final two sentences of Albert Camus' 1942 essay, *The Myth of Sisyphus*: \"The struggle itself toward the heights (of the mountain) is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\" It is not just the goal of getting the huge stone to the top of the mountain that is important, but the ongoing willingness to push it up.\n\n Michael Morgan will conduct the local performances of the opera, with members of the Oakland Symphony Orchestra in the pit. Beth Green is the stage director and Michael Antaky, the set designer.\n\n The pivotal role of the stage manager will be performed by Richard Byrne, with soprano Marnie Breckenridge singing the role of Emily Webb and tenor Thomas Glenn, the role of George Gibbs.\n\n.\n\n*\n\nCheryl North, Tappan Wilder, and\nWarner North, at dinner prior to the\nFestival Opera production of Our Town*\n August 2007\n\n[.](http://www.dunningmarketing.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/) [.](http://www.witnessamerica.com/camcorders) [.](http://www.ksql.com/) [.](http://www.ascendaviation.com/) [.](http://www.echovalleysupply.com/) [.](http://www.northworks.net/) [.](http://www.attainia.com/) [.](http://www.briandunning.com/) [.](http://www.rolandovillazon.com/)\n",
