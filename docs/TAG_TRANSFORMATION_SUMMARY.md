```

#### Professional Content (w-main.md)
```yaml
# BEFORE (No Tags)
subjects: []

# AFTER (Comprehensive)
subjects:
  - D. Warner North              # Subject person
  - Decision Analysis            # Core expertise
  - Stanford University          # Affiliation
  - Environmental Protection Agency # Key organization
  - Probabilistic Risk Assessment # Methodology
```

- **Professional networking**: Connect related expertise and organizations
- **Musical connections**: Link composers, works, and performers
- **Venue-based discovery**: Explore content by performance locations

### 🎪 **Content Categories Enhanced**

| Content Type | Key Improvements |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Interviews** | Added interviewee names, venues, discussed works |
| **Reviews** | Specific venues, featured artists, performed works |
| **Articles** | Topic entities, musical works, cultural context |
| **Professional** | Methodologies, organizations, expertise areas |

### 📊 **Quality Metrics**

| Metric | Current | Target | Tool |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| Files with Good Tags | 50.4% | 85%+ | smart-tags.js |
| Files with Poor Tags | 27.7% | <5% | priority-tags.js |
| Missing Key Entities | 40%+ | <10% | implement-tags.js |
| Average Tags per File | 8.6 | 6-8 (higher quality) | All scripts |

## Technical Architecture

### AI Entity Recognition
```javascript
// Examples of extracted entities
People: "Iréne Theorin", "Kurt Masur", "D. Warner North"
Venues: "San Francisco Opera", "Davies Symphony Hall"
Works: "Ring Cycle", "Turandot", "War Requiem"
Organizations: "Stanford University", "EPA"
```

### Quality Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Scoring system
+2 points: Specific entity (person, venue, work)
+1 point: Present in content, properly formatted
 0 points: Generic but acceptable
-1 point: Poor quality (too generic)
-3 points: Not found in content (invalid)
```

### Content Type Detection
```javascript
// Automatic classification
'c_interview*' → Interview content (focus on people)
'c_reviews*'   → Review content (focus on performances)
'c_art*'       → Article content (focus on topics)
'w-*'          → Professional content (focus on expertise)
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
```bash
# Fix the most problematic files
node scripts/priority-tags.js --apply
```
**Target**: 8 critical files with missing essential tags

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Improvement (1-2 days)
