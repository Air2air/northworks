Cheryl North Interviews Donald Runnicles**

ANG Newspapers Classical Music Column - January 16, 2004*, under
headline, **"San Francisco Opera's music director triumphant in Berlin."**

How lucky can we get? Within the confines of the Bay Area, we have three of the world's best, most sought-after classical music conductors.

We have not only Michael Tilson Thomas presiding at the helm of
the San Francisco Symphony and Maestro Kent Nagano working wonders
as conductor of the Berkeley Symphony, but we also have ever-amazing
Donald Runnicles, music director of the San Francisco Opera.

Runnicles has just returned from a major triumph conducting the
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on its own exalted turf. The often
reserved German newspapers broke tradition and raved about our

*

maestro's brilliance in conducting Benjamin Britten's "War Requiem"
last month.

Audiences were unabashedly demonstrative, as were the orchestra
members themselves. The Berliner Tagesspiegel* critic noted, "It is after all something of an upside-down world when our fabulous
Berliner Philharmonic Orchestra turns around on its orchestral stage
to applaud..." while the Berliner *Morgenpost* critic extolled
"Finally another successful conducting debut with the Berlin
Philharmonic!" The critique ended by praising Runnicles for
succeeding in "giving form to the contemporary relevance of the
(Britten) work" and summarized with "At the end tears were not wiped
away, but a quiet joy over the achievement of the ensemble, and the
Philharmonic's lucky choice of Runnicles, nevertheless triumphed."

**San Francisco is home**

We here in the Bay Area can hear and experience Runnicles'
dynamic conducting several times a month during opera season and off
and on during the year as piano accompanist for singers' recitals
and chamber music concerts.

Runnicles may be an Edinburgh-born Scot, but he has made his home
in San Francisco. Before the Berlin engagement he said, "I think
this is a wonderful place to live.... I greatly love being at home,
just pottering around. I don't like being peripatetic and flying
around from branch to branch. I'm connected to the Earth."

His cozy office in the San Francisco Opera House is liberally
decorated with scenes of San Francisco and snapshots of his
daughters.

His voice warmed and his Scottish burr deepened when he spoke of
his South African-born wife, Elizabeth (whom he described as "the
girl of my dreams"), and their daughters, Ashley Isolde, turning 6
this month, and 8-year-old Tamara Sophie.

**Named for productions**

"They are both little San Franciscans," he said. "Ashley was born
when I was in a 'Tristan und Isolde' production in Cologne. We knew
that the baby would have to be induced so I came across in time to
be here for her birth and then flew back to Cologne for the
'Tristan' performances." Hence, the name Ashley Isolde.

"We found out about Tamara just after rehearsals for 'Der
Rosenkavalier' in Berlin back in '94, so we gave the name Sophie (the ingenue role in the opera) to Tamara."

Elizabeth Runnicles, too, has found fertile ground in San
Francisco. She's an accomplished violist and her husband describes
her as "being very active in chamber music in the area."

When I first interviewed Runnicles 10 years ago, he revealed that
he met Elizabeth while he was conducting in Freiberg, Germany. "She
auditioned for the orchestra and made a great impression, not only
on me, but on the whole orchestra," he said. Shortly thereafter, she
was made a full-fledged member of the orchestra and she and
Runnicles got engaged.

Soon after that, the two moved to San Francisco and he began his
job with the San Francisco Opera.

When he looks back over the achievements of the last 10 years,
Runnicles said he feels "a little like a farmer who plants seeds in
very rich soil."

A positive working environment, which includes good relationships
with San Francisco Opera's General Director, Pamela Rosenberg, is
one thing Runnicles finds so rewarding about being music director.

"I feel very supported -- we talk about everything and we plan
everything together. I can only hope that we continue to be given
the chance, as we have been up until now, of introducing audiences
to new works. There is a pioneering, ambassadorial side to my work,
my mandate, as the opera's music director. It brings with it an
enormous responsibility with an enormous sense of fulfillment when
we can introduce people to new music and they think after
experiencing our 'Lady Macbeth' production, 'My goodness...
Shostakovich! I must go out and buy his symphonies...'"

The Shostakovich "Macbeth" production came within a decimal point
of outdoing "The Magic Flute" as the best-sold opera of this season.
And the Messian "St. Fran'ois d'Assise" was the best-selling
production last season.

"You just never know those things in advance. I suppose one of
the challenges of the next few years is that we don't necessarily
need to look to the traditional repertoire for cash cows. It may be
that more and more people want to be challenged with new things."

"Now I'm not putting a positive spin on these things," he
cautioned. "This is not spin; these are facts. And what does that
tell us? That people feel they're being given as good as it gets."

**'A real love affair'**

Ten years ago, his goal was to conduct more Wagner operas. Since
then he has been in the Bayreuth Festival and has conducted Ring
Cycles in Vienna almost yearly.

"I've had a real love affair with the Vienna Orchestra," he said,
praising "its stylistic idiosyncrasies, the burnished sound of the
horns, the sweetness of the woodwinds, the muscular strength of its
strings.

"All of this has an impact in terms of bringing that experience
back to the San Francisco Opera Orchestra to work on its sound. It's
extremely fulfilling working with the same orchestra over a decade."

"It's made more so in that I have a terrific partner in Pamela,
who wants me to be conducting as much as I can so that the bond
between conductor and orchestra can only deepen. It then becomes
less and less work, because we know one another so well."

He also noted that he loved doing "Parsifal" in San Francisco in
2000 and having Nikolas Lehnhoff's mind "probing into the piece."

Although one of his focuses has always been Wagner, Runnicles
emphasizes he enjoys many other works. "I especially enjoyed conducting 'Pell'as et M'lisande.' Fell in love with it, and hope to do it again. I've always been very happy to cover as broad a repertoire as I can."

"For one to grow," he philosophized, "it's necessary that
nutrients be drawn from other things -- a cross-fertilization is
needed. My German opera conducting is all the better for the fact
that I've conducted Italian opera; my Italian opera is better for my
having conducted French opera; and my French is better for having
conducted Russian and Czech. Similarly, a fulfilled singer is very
often a singer whose operatic experiences are informed by singing
Lieder."

"Furthermore, I have changed as a person. Being a father to two
young girls informs everything I do, whether it's chatting with you,
working with my assistants or my orchestras, or when conducting an
opera dealing with father/child content."

He recalled a recent conversation with the great Wagner
bass-baritone James Morris following a production of Wagner's "Die
Walk're" in Vienna during which Morris, in the role of Wotan, had
choked up in the final farewell duet with his daughter Br'nnhilde.
It was the first production Morris had sung since his wife, Susan
Quittmeyer, gave birth to twins.

**'Lived a wonderful life'**

Morris explained to Runnicles that although he had sung that role
often, having children helped deepen his understanding of the part.
"I've sung that role so often, and I know how to sing it," Morris
explained to Runnicles. "But I swear, now, having those young
children myself, and now imagining that it was Jennie that I was
taking leave of forever -- it just completely got to me and deepened
my performance."

"That's what we're talking about here," Runnicles summarized. "I
think that within the past 10 years here, I've lived a wonderful
life. I continue to live a wonderful life. That can't help but
inform and imbue my music making -- for better or worse, I might
add."
