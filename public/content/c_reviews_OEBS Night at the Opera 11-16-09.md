<b>Oakland East Bay Symphony Performance, "A Night at the Opera"</b>
<p></p>
Review of November 13 performance published in papers and website of the Bay Area News Group on November 16, 2009, under the headline,"'Oakland East Bay Symphony opening a hit despite venue glitches."' 
<p></p>

It's clear that the people of Oakland and its outlying areas love their symphony orchestra. The cavernous Paramount Theatre was nearing capacity and the surrounding parking lots were packed by 7:55 p.m. Friday in readiness for "A Night at the Opera," the OEBS' season-opening performance. One stately Oakland widow, leaning heavily on her cane, had braved a long, six-block trek from her car to the Paramount to enjoy what she called "a beautiful, inspirational concert." 
<p></p>
With this and many other examples of strong audience support for the orchestra and Michael Morgan, its charismatic conductor for 20 years, in mind, I hesitate to write a single negative word. But my honest assessment is that the Paramount is not a very good venue for opera. While the instrumental ensemble sounded richly sonorous and full-bodied and Maestro Morgan proved a powerful but sensitive presence on the podium, the hall's acoustics inhibited most of the solo singers from projecting the full sonic timbres of their voices. 
<p></p>
Another possible victim of the acoustics was a slightly wan-sounding (redeemed somewhat by OEBS' noble brass) <i>Siegfried's Funeral Music</i> from Wagner's <i>Die Gotterdammerung</i>, under the direction of assistant conductor Brian Nies.
<p></p>
The musicianship of the onstage performers was excellent. The orchestra shone with a warmly enveloping sound in the evening's opening work, the brass-rich Overture to Carl Maria von Weber's opera <i>Der Freischutz</i>, as well as in Verdi's Overture to <i>Nabucco</i> and the lovely, almost prayer-like <i>Intermezzo</i> from Mascagni's <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>. 
<p></p>
The roster of fine operatic singers included sopranos Hope Briggs and Heidi Moss; mezzo-soprano Patrice Houston; tenors Kalil Wilson and AJ Glueckert; baritones Brian Leerhuber and Zachary Gordin; and bass-baritone Joshua Bloom, along with the choral skills of the Oakland Symphony Chorus, conducted by Lynne Morrow, and the Oakland-East Bay Gay Men's Chorus, conducted by Michael Robert Patch.
<p></p>
Wilson was sometimes overpowered by the orchestra in <i>Lonely House</i> from Kurt Weill's <i>Street Scene</i>, which he sang lyrically in an appropriately jazz-blues-opera style. This was followed by scientist-singer Moss' affecting aria, <i>Je marche sur tous les chemins</i> from Massenet's <i>Manon</i>, and baritone Gordin's rendition of that same composer's <i>Vision fugitive</i> from <i>Herodiade</i>. 
<p></p>
The evening's high points included honey-voiced soprano Briggs in a powerfully moving <i>Pace, pace mio Dio!</i> from Verdi's <i>La Forza del Destino</i>; baritone Brian Leerhuber's poignantly mesmerizing <i>Mein Sehnen, Mein Wahnen</i> ("Tanzlied") from Korngold's <i>Die Tote Stadt</i> and Bloom's <i>La del ciel nell'arcano profondo</i> from Rossini's <i>La Cenerentola</i>.
<p></p>
Donizetti's glorious Sextet from his <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>, featuring Briggs, Houston, Wilson, Glueckert, Gordin, Bloom and the Oakland Symphony Chorus, was up at a similar heady level, as were the ensemble performances of the "Triumphal Scene" from Verdi's <i>Aida</i> and the achingly beautiful rendition of <i>Make Our Garden Grow</i> from Bernstein's <i>Candide</i>.
